# Use Azure PowerShell to [task]

This article shows you how to [task], using commands from both the Azure module and the Azure Resource Manager module. This is intended to help you learn the new commands as well as migrate existing scripts to the new commands.

## Prerequisite: Install a Recent Version of Azure PowerShell

If you haven't done so already, install at least the [version number] version of Azure PowerShell on your local computer. If you use an earlier version, it won't have the Azure Resource Manager cmdlets described in this article. For details, see:
 
- [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](install-configure-powershell.md) for instructions on setting up Azure PowerShell.
- [Using Windows PowerShell with Resource Manager](powershell-azure-resource-manager.md) for basics on using Resource Manager.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Most tasks require you to use an administrator-level Azure PowerShell command prompt.

## Command Comparison

This [table | section] shows the command syntax.

<!--[optional image - to use an image in this article, add a folder with the same name as the article file name without extension, inside the Media folder of the repo. Use only this folder to store the images. Don't attempt to use a common folder to share images you want to use in more than 1 file.]
Then, use the following syntax to add a reference to the image in your article:
![](./media/name-of-file-without-extension/image-name-no-spaces.png)
-->

<!--if a command string uses variables, define the variables first, using the  following construction. In some cases the variable is straightforward and doesn't need much explanation. But parameters such as location and size can benefit from brief explanation or listing all accepted values:--> 

These command examples use the following variables:

$FriendlyName"<Describe value>"

<!-- if it makes more sense to present this in a table, use this. Otherwise, delete. The table won't render until it's in Github or published to Sandbox.-->

Service Management | Resource Manager
---|----
`syntax` | `syntax`


<!--if it makes more sense to present this one command block after the other instead of a table, use this. Otherwise, delete-->
  
[Short intro sentence about the command. Omit if there's really nothing to say. But if it uses approaches such a the pipeline, explain that]:

	[command string]

## Script Examples

Here's an example that uses [cmdlet names)] to [task]. It includes commands that:

- [short verb, uses, has, is, etc]
- [next short verb] 

<!--include this statement if it uses variables that weren't introduced earlier--> It includes the following variables:

- [variable 1]
- [variable 2]
