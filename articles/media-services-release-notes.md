- Added relative offsets for BeginDate and ExpirationDate in the PlayReady license template.


##<a id="november_changes_14"></a>November 2014 Release

- Media Services now enables you to ingest a live Smooth Streaming (FMP4) content over an SSL connection. To ingest over SSL, make sure to update the ingest URL to HTTPS.  For more information about live streaming, see [Working with Azure Media Services Live Streaming].
- Note that currently, you cannot ingest an RTMP live stream over an SSL connection.
- You can also stream your content over an SSL connection. To do this, make sure your streaming URLs start with HTTPS.
- Note that you can only stream over SSL if the streaming endpoint from which you deliver your content was created after September 10th, 2014. If your streaming URLs are based on the streaming endpoints created after September 10th, the URL contains “streaming.mediaservices.windows.net” (the new format). Streaming URLs that contain “origin.mediaservices.windows.net” (the old format) do not support SSL. If your URL is in the old format and you want to be able to stream over SSL, [create a new streaming endpoint](media-services-manage-origins.md). Use URLs created based on the new streaming endpoint to stream your content over SSL.

##<a id="september_changes_14"></a>September 2014 Release

Media Services REST metadata is now version 2.7. For more information about the latest REST updates, see [Azure Media Services REST API Reference].

Media Services SDK for .NET is now version 3.0.0.7
 
### <a id="sept_14_breaking_changes"></a>Breaking Changes

* **Origin** was renamed to [StreamingEndpoint].
* A change in the default behavior when using the **Azure Management Portal** to encode and then publish MP4 files. 

	Previously, when using the Management Portal to publish a single-file MP4 video asset a SAS URL would be created (SAS URLs allow you to download the video from a blob storage). Currently, when you use the Management Portal to encode and then publish a single-file MP4 video asset, the generated URL points to an Azure Media Services streaming endpoint.  This change does not affect MP4 videos that are directly uploaded to Media Services and published without being encoded by Azure Media Services.
	
	Currently, you have the following two options to solve the problem. 
	
	* Enable streaming units and use dynamic packaging to stream the .mp4 asset as a smooth streaming presentation.
	
	* Create a SAS url to download (or progressively play) the .mp4. For more information about how to create a SAS locator, see [Delivering Content]. 


### <a id="sept_14_GA_changes"></a>New features\scenarios that are part of GA release

* **Indexer Media Processor**. For more information see [Indexing Media Files with Azure Media Indexer].

* The [StreamingEndpoint] entity now enables you to add custom domain (host) names.

	For a custom domain name to be used as the Media Services streaming endpoint name, you need to add custom host names to your streaming endpoint. Use the Media Services REST APIs or .NET SDK to add custom host names.
	
	The following considerations apply:
	
	* You must have the ownership of the custom domain name.
	
	* The ownership of the domain name must be validated by Azure Media Services. To validate the domain, create a CName that maps <MediaServicesAccountId>.<parent domain> to verifydns.<mediaservices-dns-zone>. 
	
	* You must create another CName  that maps the custom host name (for example,  sports.contoso.com) to your Media Services StreamingEndpont’s host name (for example,  amstest.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net).


	For more information, see the **CustomHostNames** property in the [StreamingEndpoint] topic.

### <a id="sept_14_preview_changes"></a>New features\scenarios that are part of the public preview release

* Live Streaming Preview. For more information, see [Working with Azure Media Services Live Streaming].

* Key Delivery Service. For more information, see [Using AES-128 Dynamic Encryption and Key Delivery Service].

* AES Dynamic Encryption. For more information, see [Using AES-128 Dynamic Encryption and Key Delivery Service].

* PlayReady License Delivery Service. For more information, see [Using PlayReady Dynamic Encryption and License Delivery Service].

* PlayReady Dynamic Encryption. For more information, see [Using PlayReady Dynamic Encryption and License Delivery Service].

* Media Services PlayReady License Template. For more information, see [Media Services PlayReady License Template Overview].

* Streaming storage encrypted assets. For more information, see [Streaming Storage Encrypted Content].

##<a id="august_changes_14"></a>August 2014 Release

When you encode an asset, an output asset is produced upon completion of the encoding job. Until this release, Azure Media Services Encoder produced metadata about output assets. Starting with this release the encoder also produces metadata about input assets. For more information, see the [Input Metadata] and [Output Metadata] topics.


##<a id="july_changes_14"></a>July 2014 Release

The following bug fixes were made for the Azure Media Services Packager and Encryptor:

* Only audio plays back when transmuxing a live archive asset to HTTP Live Streaming – this has been fixed and now both audio and video are played.

* When packaging an asset to HTTP Live Streaming and AES 128-bit envelope encryption, the packaged streams do not play back on Android devices – this bug has been fixed and the packaged stream plays back on Android devices that support HTTP Live Streaming.

##<a id="may_changes_14"></a>May 2014 Release

### <a id="may_14_changes"></a>General Media Services Updates

You can now use [Dynamic Packaging] to stream HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) v3. To stream HLS v3, add the following format to the origin locator path: *.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl-v3). For more information, see [Nick Drouin's Blog].

Dynamic Packaging now also supports delivering HLS (v3 and v4) encrypted with PlayReady based on Smooth Streaming statically encrypted with PlayReady. For information on how to encrypt Smooth Streaming with PlayReady, see [Protecting Smooth Stream with PlayReady].

### <a name="may_14_donnet_changes"></a>Media Services .NET SDK Updates

The following improvements are included in the Media Services .NET SDK 3.0.0.5 release:

* Better speed and resilience for uploading/downloading media assets.

* Improvements in retry logic and transient exception handling: 

	* Transient error detection and retry logic were improved for exceptions that are caused by querying, saving changes, uploading or downloading files. 
	
	* When getting Web Exceptions (for example, during an ACS token request), you will notice that fatal errors are failing faster now.

For more information, see [Retry Logic in the Media Services SDK for .NET].

##<a id="april_changes_14"></a>April 2014 Encoder Release

### <a name="april_14_enocer_changes"></a>Media Services Encoder Updates

* Added support for ingesting AVI files authored using the Grass Valley EDIUS nonlinear editor, where the video is lightly compressed using Grass Valley HQ/HQX codec. For more information, see [Grass Valley Announces EDIUS 7 Streaming Through the Cloud].

* Added support for specifying the naming convention for the files produced by the Media Encoder. For more information, see [Controlling Media Service Encoder Output Filenames].

* Added support for video and/or audio overlays. For more information, see [Creating Overlays].

* Added support for stitching together multiple video segments. For more information, see [Stitching Video Segments].

* Fixed a bug related to transcoding of MP4s where the audio has been encoded with MPEG-1 Audio layer 3 (aka MP3).


##<a id="jan_feb_changes_14"></a>January\February 2014 Releases

### <a name="jan_fab_14_donnet_changes"></a>Azure Media Services .NET SDK 3.0.0.1, 3.0.0.2 and 3.0.0.3

##<a id="december_changes_12"></a>December 2012 Release

### <a name="dec_12_dotnet_changes"></a>Azure Media Services .NET SDK changes

* Intellisense : Added missing Intellisense documentation for many types.

* Microsoft.Practices.TransientFaultHandling.Core : Fixed an issue where the SDK still had a dependency to an old version of this assembly. The SDK now references version 5.1.1209.1 of this assembly.

Fixes for issues found in the November 2012 SDK:

* IAsset.Locators.Count : This count is now correctly reported on new IAsset interfaces after all locators have been deleted.

* IAssetFile.ContentFileSize : This value is now properly set after an upload by IAssetFile.Upload(filepath).

* IAssetFile.ContentFileSize : This property can now be set when creating an asset file. It was previously read-only.

* IAssetFile.Upload(filepath) : Fixed an issue where this synchronous upload method was throwing the following error when uploading multiple files to the asset. The error was "Server failed to authenticate the request. Make sure the value of Authorization header is formed correctly including the signature."

* IAssetFile.UploadAsync : Fixed an issue where no more than 5 files could be uploaded simultaneously.

* IAssetFile.UploadProgressChanged : This event is now provided by the SDK.

* IAssetFile.DownloadAsync(string, BlobTransferClient, ILocator, CancellationToken): This method overload is now provided.

* IAssetFile.DownloadAsync : Fixed an issue where no more than 5 files could be downloaded simultaneously.

* IAssetFile.Delete() : Fixed an issue where calling delete may throw an exception if no file was uploaded for the IAssetFile.

* Jobs : Fixed an issue where chaining a "MP4 to Smooth Streams task" with a "PlayReady Protection Task" using a job template would not create any tasks at all.

* EncryptionUtils.GetCertificateFromStore() : This method no longer throws a null reference exception due to a failures finding the certificate based on certificate configuration issues.

##<a id="november_changes_12"></a>November 2012 Release

The changes mentioned in this section were updates included in the November 2012 (version 2.0.0.0) SDK. These changes may require any code written for the June 2012 preview SDK release to be modified or rewritten.

* Assets
	
	IAsset.Create(assetName) is the ONLY asset creation function. IAsset.Create no longer uploads files as part of the method call. Use IAssetFile for uploading.
	
	The IAsset.Publish method and the AssetState.Publish enumeration value have been removed from the Services SDK. Any code that relies on this value must be re-written.

* FileInfo

	This class has been removed and replaced by IAssetFile.

	IAssetFiles

	IAssetFile replaces FileInfo and has a different behavior. To use it, instantiate the IAssetFiles object, followed by a file upload either using the Media Services SDK or the Azure Storage SDK. The following IAssetFile.Upload overloads can be used:

	* IAssetFile.Upload(filePath): A synchronous method that blocks the thread and is recommended only when uploading a single file.
	
	* IAssetFile.UploadAsync(filePath, blobTransferClient, locator, cancellationToken): An asynchronous method. This is the preferred upload mechanism. 

	Known bug: using the cancellationToken will indeed cancel the upload; however, the cancellation state of the tasks can be any of a number of states. You must properly catch and handle exceptions.

* Locators
	
	The Origin-specific versions have been removed. The SAS-specific context.Locators.CreateSasLocator(asset, accessPolicy) will be marked deprecated, or removed by GA. See the Locators section under New Functionality for updated behavior.


##<a id="june_changes_12"></a>June 2012 Preview Release

The following functionality was new in the November release of the SDK.

* Deleting Entities

	IAsset, IAssetFile, ILocator, IAccessPolicy, IContentKey objects are now deleted at the object level, i.e. IObject.Delete(), instead of requiring a delete in the Collection, that is cloudMediaContext.ObjCollection.Delete(objInstance).

* Locators

	Locators must now be created using the CreateLocator method and use the LocatorType.SAS or LocatorType.OnDemandOrigin enum values as an argument for the specific type of locator you want to create.

	New properties were added to Locators to make it easier to obtain usable URIs for your content. This redesign of Locators was meant to provide more flexibility for future third-party extensibility and increase ease-of-use for media client applications.

* Asynchronous Method Support

	Asynchronous support has been added to all methods.
