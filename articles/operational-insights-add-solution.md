# Operational Insights solutions

[AZURE.INCLUDE [operational-insights-note-moms](../includes/operational-insights-note-moms.md)]

Microsoft Azure Operational Insights includes the base Configuration Assessment module. However, you can get additional functionality by adding solutions to it from the Overview page.

After you have added a solution, data is collected from the servers in your infrastructure and sent to the Operational Insights service. Processing by the Operational Insights service can take from a few minutes to several hours. After the service processes the data, you can view it in Operational Insights.

You can easily remove a solution when it is no longer needed. When you remove a solution, its data is not sent to Operational Insights, which reduces the amount of data used by your daily quota.

## Solutions supported by the Microsoft Monitoring Agent

At this time, servers that are connected directly to Microsoft Azure Operational Insights using the Microsoft Monitoring Agent can use most of the solutions available, including:

- [System Updates](operational-insights-updates.md)

- [Log Management](operational-insights-log-collection.md)

- [Antimalware](operational-insights-antimalware.md)

- [Change Tracking](operational-insights-change-tracking.md)

- [SQL and Active Directory Assessment](operational-insights-assessment.md)

However, the following solutions are *not* supported with the Microsoft Monitoring Agent

- [Capacity Management](operational-insights-capacity.md)

- [Configuration Assessment](operational-insights-configuration-assessment.md)

IIS log collection is supported on computers with:

- Windows Server 2012

- Windows Server 2012 R2
