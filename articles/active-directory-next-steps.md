# What are the next steps I can take using Azure AD?

## Manage users in Azure AD
Managing user accounts is more than just creating or deleting users and assigning permissions. You can generate reports on access and usage, set password policies, enable password self-service rest, set up multifactor authentication and more. [Learn more about managing users](active-directory-create-users.md).

## Sync and manage passwords
Sync user passwords so that your users can sign into Microsoft cloud services (such as Office 365, Dynamics CRM, and Windows InTune) using the same password that they use to sign in to your on-premises network. [Learn more about managing passwords](active-directory-manage-passwords.md).

## Manage groups in Azure AD
Use groups to assign a common set of permissions and rights to many accounts at once, instead of to each account individually. You can also sync groups from your local on-premises Windows Server Active Directory. Learn more about managing groups in Azure Active Directory. [Learn more about managing groups](active-directory-manage-groups.md).

## Enforce conditional access policies for registered mobile devices
Azure AD Device Registration provisions devices with an identity that is used to authenticate the device when the user signs in. The authenticated device, and the attributes of the device, can then be used to enforce conditional access policies for applications that are hosted in the cloud and on-premises. [Learn more about Azure AD Device Registration](active-directory-conditional-access.md).
