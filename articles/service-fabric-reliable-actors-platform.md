# How Fabric Actors use the Service Fabric platform

## Service Fabric application model concepts for actors
Actors use the Service Fabric application model to manage the application lifecycle. Every Actor type is mapped to a Service Fabric [Service type](service-fabric-application-model.md#describe-a-service). The actor code is [packaged](service-fabric-application-model.md#package-an-application) as a Service Fabric application and [deployed](service-fabric-deploy-remove-applications.md#deploy-an-application) to the cluster.

Let's take the example of an actor project [created using Visual Studio](service-fabric-reliable-actors-get-started.md), to illustrate some of the above concepts.

The application manifest, service manifest and Settings.xml configuration file are included in the project for the actor service when the solution is created in Visual Studio. This is shown in the screenshot below.

The application type and version of the application that the actor is packaged into can be found by looking at the application manifest that is included in the project for the actor service. The following snippet from an application manifest is an example of this.

~~~
<ApplicationManifest xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
                     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                     ApplicationTypeName="VoiceMailBoxApplication"
                     ApplicationTypeVersion="1.0.0.0"
                     xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric">
~~~

The service type that the actor type maps to can be found by looking at the service manifest that is included in the project for the actor service. The following snippet from a service manifest is an example of this.

~~~
<StatefulServiceType ServiceTypeName="VoiceMailBoxActorServiceType" HasPersistedState="true">
~~~

When the application package is created using Visual Studio, the logs in the Build Output window indicate the location of the application package. For example:

    -------- Package started: Project: VoiceMailBoxApplication, Configuration: Debug x64 ------
    VoiceMailBoxApplication -> C:\samples\Samples\Actors\VS2015\VoiceMailBox\VoiceMailBoxApplication\pkg\Debug

The following is a partial listing of the above location (full listing omitted for brevity):

The listing above shows the assemblies that implement the VoicemailBox actor getting included in the code package within the service package within the application package.  

The Visual Studio solution includes the PowerShell scripts that are used to deploy the application to and remove the application from the cluster. The scripts are circled in the screenshot below.

![][2]

Subsequent management (i.e. upgrades and eventual deletion) of the application is also performed using Service Fabric application management mechanisms. For more information, please see the topics on the [application model](service-fabric-application-model.md), [application deployment and removal](service-fabric-deploy-remove-applications.md), and [application upgrade](service-fabric-application-upgrade.md).

## Scalability for actor services
Cluster administrators can create one or more actor services of each service type in the cluster. Each of those actor services can have one or more partitions (similar to any other Service Fabric service). The ability to create multiple services of a service type (which maps to an actor type) and the ability to create multiple partitions for a service allow the actor application to scale. Please see the article on [scalability](service-fabric-concepts-scalability.md) for more information.

## Service Fabric partition concepts for actors
The actor ID of an actor is mapped to a partition of an actor service. The actor is created within the partition that its actor ID maps to. When an actor is created, the Actors runtime writes an [EventSource event](service-fabric-reliable-actors-diagnostics.md#eventsource-events) that indicates which partition the actor is created in. Below is an example of this event that indicates that an actor with ID `-5349766044453424161` was created within partition `0583c745-1bed-43b2-9545-29d7e3448156` of service `fabric:/VoicemailBoxAdvancedApplication/VoicemailBoxActorService`, application `fabric:/VoicemailBoxAdvancedApplication`.

    {
      "Timestamp": "2015-04-26T10:12:20.2485941-07:00",
      "ProviderName": "Microsoft-ServiceFabric-Actors",
      "Id": 5,
      "Message": "Actor activated. Actor type: Microsoft.Azure.Service.Fabric.Samples.VoicemailBox.VoiceMailBoxActor, actor ID: -5349766044453424161, stateful: True, replica/instance ID: 130,745,418,574,851,853, partition ID: 0583c745-1bed-43b2-9545-29d7e3448156.",
      "EventName": "ActorActivated",
      "Payload": {
        "actorType": "Microsoft.Azure.Service.Fabric.Samples.VoicemailBox.VoiceMailBoxActor",
        "actorId": "-5349766044453424161",
        "isStateful": "True",
        "replicaOrInstanceId": "130745418574851853",
        "partitionId": "0583c745-1bed-43b2-9545-29d7e3448156",
        "serviceName": "fabric:/VoicemailBoxAdvancedApplication/VoicemailBoxActorService",
        "applicationName": "fabric:/VoicemailBoxAdvancedApplication",
      }
    }

Another actor with ID `-4952641569324299627` was created within a different partition `c146fe53-16d7-4d96-bac6-ef54613808ff` of the same service, as indicated by the event below.

    {
      "Timestamp": "2015-04-26T15:06:56.93882-07:00",
      "ProviderName": "Microsoft-ServiceFabric-Actors",
      "Id": 5,
      "Message": "Actor activated. Actor type: Microsoft.Azure.Service.Fabric.Samples.VoicemailBox.VoiceMailBoxActor, actor ID: -4952641569324299627, stateful: True, replica/instance ID: 130,745,418,574,851,853, partition ID: c146fe53-16d7-4d96-bac6-ef54613808ff.",
      "EventName": "ActorActivated",
      "Payload": {
        "actorType": "Microsoft.Azure.Service.Fabric.Samples.VoicemailBox.VoiceMailBoxActor",
        "actorId": "-4952641569324299627",
        "isStateful": "True",
        "replicaOrInstanceId": "130745418574851853",
        "partitionId": "c146fe53-16d7-4d96-bac6-ef54613808ff",
        "serviceName": "fabric:/VoicemailBoxAdvancedApplication/VoicemailBoxActorService",
        "applicationName": "fabric:/VoicemailBoxAdvancedApplication",
      }
    }

*Note:* some fields of the above events are omitted for brevity.

The partition ID can be used to get other information about the partition. For example, the [Service Fabric Explorer](service-fabric-visualizing-your-cluster.md) tool can be used to view information about the partition and the service and application to which it belongs. The screenshot below shows information about partition `c146fe53-16d7-4d96-bac6-ef54613808ff`, which contained the actor with ID `-4952641569324299627` in the above example.  

![][3]

Actors can programmatically obtain the partition ID, service name, application name and other Service Fabric platform-specific information via the `Host.ActivationContext` and the `Host.StatelessServiceInitialization` or `Host.StatefulServiceInitializationParameters` members of the base class that the actor type derives from. The following code snippet shows an example:

```csharp
public void ActorMessage<TState>(Actor<TState> actor, string message, params object[] args)
{
    string finalMessage = string.Format(message, args);
    this.ActorMessage(
        actor.GetType().ToString(),
        actor.Id.ToString(),
        actor.Host.ActivationContext.ApplicationTypeName,
        actor.Host.ActivationContext.ApplicationName,
        actor.Host.StatefulServiceInitializationParameters.ServiceTypeName,
        actor.Host.StatefulServiceInitializationParameters.ServiceName.ToString(),
        actor.Host.StatefulServiceInitializationParameters.PartitionId,
        actor.Host.StatefulServiceInitializationParameters.ReplicaId,
        FabricRuntime.GetNodeContext().NodeName,
        finalMessage);
}
```

### Service Fabric partition concepts for stateless actors
Stateless actors are created within a partition of a Service Fabric stateless service. The actor ID determines which partition the actor is created under. The actor is created inside one or more [instances](service-fabric-availability-services.md#availability-of-service-fabric-stateless-services) within that partition. When a client sends a request for a stateless actor with a particular actor ID, the request is serviced by one of the instances from the partition that the actor ID maps to. This instance is randomly chosen by the client. Therefore, if different clients communicating with the same actor ID choose different instances, then it is possible for multiple instances within a partition to each have an active actor with the same actor ID.

> [AZURE.TIP] The Fabric Actors runtime emits some [events related to stateless actor instances](service-fabric-reliable-actors-diagnostics.md#events-related-to-stateless-actor-instances). They are useful in diagnostics and performance monitoring.

When a stateless actor is created, the Actors runtime writes an [EventSource event](service-fabric-reliable-actors-diagnostics.md#eventsource-events) that indicates which partition and instance the actor is created in. Below is an example of this event that indicates that an actor with ID `abc` was created within instance `130745709600495974` of partition `8c828833-ccf1-4e21-b99d-03b14d4face3`, of service `fabric:/HelloWorldApplication/HelloWorldActorService`, application `fabric:/HelloWorldApplication`.

    {
      "Timestamp": "2015-04-26T18:17:46.1453113-07:00",
      "ProviderName": "Microsoft-ServiceFabric-Actors",
      "Id": 5,
      "Message": "Actor activated. Actor type: HelloWorld.HelloWorld, actor ID: abc, stateful: False, replica/instance ID: 130,745,709,600,495,974, partition ID: 8c828833-ccf1-4e21-b99d-03b14d4face3.",
      "EventName": "ActorActivated",
      "Payload": {
        "actorType": "HelloWorld.HelloWorld",
        "actorId": "abc",
        "isStateful": "False",
        "replicaOrInstanceId": "130745709600495974",
        "partitionId": "8c828833-ccf1-4e21-b99d-03b14d4face3",
        "serviceName": "fabric:/HelloWorldApplication/HelloWorldActorService",
        "applicationName": "fabric:/HelloWorldApplication",
      }
    }

Continuing the above example, below is another event that shows an actor with the same actor ID getting created in a different instance `130745709600495976` of the same partition. This was caused by another client communicating with the same actor ID, but picking a different instance in the partition to communicate with.

    {
      "Timestamp": "2015-04-26T18:18:10.0888046-07:00",
      "ProviderName": "Microsoft-ServiceFabric-Actors",
      "Id": 5,
      "Message": "Actor activated. Actor type: HelloWorld.HelloWorld, actor ID: abc, stateful: False, replica/instance ID: 130,745,709,600,495,976, partition ID: 8c828833-ccf1-4e21-b99d-03b14d4face3.",
      "EventName": "ActorActivated",
      "Payload": {
        "actorType": "HelloWorld.HelloWorld",
        "actorId": "abc",
        "isStateful": "False",
        "replicaOrInstanceId": "130745709600495976",
        "partitionId": "8c828833-ccf1-4e21-b99d-03b14d4face3",
        "serviceName": "fabric:/HelloWorldApplication/HelloWorldActorService",
        "applicationName": "fabric:/HelloWorldApplication",
      }
    }

*Note:* some fields of the above events are omitted for brevity.

### Service Fabric partition concepts for stateful actors
Stateful actors are created within a partition of the Service Fabric stateful service. The actor ID determines which partition the actor is created under. Each partition of the service can have one or more [replicas](service-fabric-availability-services.md#availability-of-service-fabric-stateful-services) that are placed on different nodes in the cluster. Having multiple replicas provides reliability for the actor state. The resource manager optimizes the placement based on the available fault and upgrade domains in the cluster. Two replicas of the same partition are never placed on the same node. The actors are always created in the primary replica of the partition to which their actor ID maps to.

> [AZURE.TIP] The Fabric Actors runtime emits some [events related to stateful actor replicas](service-fabric-reliable-actors-diagnostics.md#events-related-to-stateful-actor-replicas). They are useful in diagnostics and performance monitoring.

Recall that in the [VoiceMailBoxActor example presented earlier](#service-fabric-partition-concepts-for-actors), the actor with ID `-4952641569324299627` was created within partition `c146fe53-16d7-4d96-bac6-ef54613808ff`. The EventSource event from that example also indicated that the actor was created in replica `130745418574851853` of that partition. This was the primary replica of that partition at the time the actor was created. The Service Fabric Explorer screenshot below confirms this.

![][4]

## Actor state provider choices
There are some default actor state providers that are included in the Actors runtime. In order to choose an appropriate state provider for an actor service, it is necessary to understand how the state providers use the underlying Service Fabric platform features to make the actor state highly available.

By default a stateful actor uses key value store actor state provider. This state provider is built on the distributed Key-Value store provided by Service Fabric platform. The state is durably saved on the local disk of the node hosting the primary [replica](service-fabric-availability-services.md#availability-of-service-fabric-stateful-services), as well as replicated and durably saved on the local disks of nodes hosting the secondary replicas. The state save is complete only when a quorum of replicas has committed the state to their local disks. The Key-Value store has advanced capabilities to detect inconsistencies such as false progress and correct them automatically.

The Actors runtime also includes a `VolatileActorStateProvider`. This state provider replicates the state to replicas but the state remains in-memory on the replica. If one replica goes down and comes back up, its state is rebuilt from the other replica. However if all of the replicas (copies of the state) go down simultaneously the state data will be lost. Therefore, this state provider is suitable for applications where the data can survive failures of few replicas and can survive the planned failovers such as upgrades. If all replicas (copies) are lost, then the data needs to be recreated using mechanisms external to Service Fabric. You can configure your stateful actor to use volatile actor state provider by adding the `VolatileActorStateProvider` attribute to the actor class or an assembly level attribute.

The following code snippet shows how to changes all actors in the assembly that does not have an explicit state provider attribute to use `VolatileActorStateProvider`.

```csharp
[assembly:Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Actors.VolatileActorStateProvider]
```

The following code snippet shows how to change the state provider for a particular actor type, `VoicemailBox` in this case, to be `VolatileActorStateProvider`.

```csharp
[VolatileActorStateProvider]
public class VoicemailBoxActor : Actor<VoicemailBox>, IVoicemailBoxActor
{
    public Task<List<Voicemail>> GetMessagesAsync()
    {
        return Task.FromResult(State.MessageList);
    }
    ...
}
```

Please note that changing the state provider requires the actor service to be recreated. State providers cannot be changed as part of the application upgrade.
