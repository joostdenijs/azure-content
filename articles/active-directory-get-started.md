Ready to get started? Azure AD is available to everyone for free. Sign up now for an Azure trial subscription and your directory will be waiting for you. The directory is yours whether you buy anything or not. [Try Azure AD now](http://azure.microsoft.com/trial/get-started-active-directory/)

## How should I decide which directory to use for my testing, staging, production?

If you have an existing subscription for a Microsoft cloud services such as Office 365, then you already have a directory in Azure AD and you can just use that. That directory already authenticates users who sign in to Office 365.
You just need to sign up for Azure by using the same work or school account that you use to sign in to Office 365. Then you can manage the directory in the Azure Management Portal, and add directories for testing and so on as needed. [Learn more about how to manage the directory for your Office 365 subscription in Azure](active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory.md#manage-the-directory-for-your-office-365-subscription-in-azure).

If you don't yet have a subscription for a Microsoft cloud service, then a new directory will be provisioned for your work or school when you sign up for Azure, and you can use that as your primary directory.


## How can I add my own registered domain name?
Want to add a custom domain name, or use your own registered domain name? [Learn more about adding a custom domain](active-directory-add-domain.md).

## How can I add my company branding?
With Azure AD Premium, you can add your company's logo and other branding to the Azure sign in page and Access Panel pages. [Add company branding to your Sign In and Access Panel pages](active-directory-add-company-branding.md)

## How can I integrate Azure AD with another directory?
You can set up directory synchronization between an on-premises directory and Azure AD, including password sync, and enable single-sign on for access to applications on-premises and in the cloud. [Learn more about directory integration](active-directory-aadconnect.md).

## How can I create and edit users?
Create an account for every user who will access a Microsoft cloud service. By default, users do not have administrator permissions, but you can assign them. [Learn more about creating Azure AD users](active-directory-create-users.md).

## View access and usage reports
Azure AD provides a number of reports for administrators. More reports are available in the paid editions of Azure AD, and there's a reporting API for creating your own custom reports. [Learn more about Azure AD reports](active-directory-view-access-usage-reports.md).
