# Service Tiers

[SQL Database](sql-database-technical-overview.md) is available in Basic, Standard, and Premium service tiers. All three service tiers have an uptime [SLA](http://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/) of 99.99% and offer predictable performance, flexible business continuity options, security features, and hourly billing. With multiple performance levels within each service tier, you have the flexibility to choose the level that best meets your workloadâ€™s demands. If you need to scale up or down, you can easily change the tiers of your database in the Azure Portal, with zero-downtime for your application. See [Changing Database Service Tiers and Performance Levels](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn369872.aspx) for details.
