# SQL Database elastic database pool reference (preview)

For SaaS developers who have tens, hundreds, or even thousands of databases, an elastic database pool simplifies the process of creating, maintaining, and managing both performance and cost across the entire group of databases. 

This reference provides links and details to elastic pool articles and programmability information.

## Overview

An elastic pool is a collection of database throughput units (DTUs), and storage (GBs) that are shared by multiple databases. Elastic databases can be added to, and removed from the pool at any time. Elastic databases in the pool utilize only the resources they require from the pool freeing up available resources for only the active databases that need them.



## Prerequisites for creating and managing elastic pools


- Elastic pools are only available in Azure SQL Database V12 servers.   
- PowerShell and REST APIs for elastic pools are supported on Azure Resource Manager (ARM) only; service management commands (RDFE) are not supported. 
- Creating and managing elastic pools is supported in the [Microsoft Azure portal](https:portal.azure.com) only. 


## Restrictions for the current preview

- The pricing tier for an elastic pool in the current preview is Standard.  
- Import of a database directly into an elastic pool is not supported. You can import into a stand-alone database and then move the database into a pool. Export of a database from within a pool is supported.

## Namespace and endpoint details
An elastic pool is an ARM resource of type “ElasticPool” in the Microsoft Azure SQL Database.

- **namespace**: Microsoft.Sql/ElasticPool
- **secondary-endpoint** for REST API calls (Azure resource manager): https://management.azure.com



## Elastic database pool properties

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| creationDate | Date the pool is created. |
| databaseDtuMax | Maximum number of DTUs that a single database in the pool may use.  The database DTU max is not a resource guarantee. The DTU max applies to all databases in the pool. |
| databaseDtuMin | Minimum number of DTUs that a single database in the pool is guaranteed. The database DTU min may be set to 0. The DTU min applies to all databases in the pool. Note that the product of the number of databases in the pool and the database DTU min cannot exceed the DTUs of the pool itself. |
| Dtu | Number of DTUs shared by all databases in the pool. |
| edition | Service tier of the pool.  Every database within the pool has this edition. |
| elasticPoolId | GUID of the instance of the pool. |
| elasticPoolName | Name of the pool.  The name is unique relative to its parent server. |
| location | Data center location where the pool was created. |
| state | State is “Disabled” if payment of the bill for subscription is delinquent, and “Ready” otherwise. |
| storageMB | Storage limit in MB for the pool.  Any single database in the pool can use up to Standard Edition storage limit (250 GB), but the total of storage used by all databases in the pool cannot exceed this pool limit.   |


## DTU and storage limits for elastic pools and elastic databases

The storage limit of the pool is determined by the amount of DTUs of the pool; each DTU = 1 GB storage.  For example, a 200 DTU pool has a storage limit of 200 GB.

| property | default value | valid values |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Dtu | 200 | 200, 400, 800, 1200 |
| databaseDtuMax | 100 | 10, 20, 50 100 |
| databaseDtuMin | 0 | 0, 10, 20, 50 |
| storageMB | 200 GB*  | 200 GB, 400 GB, 800 GB, 1200 GB |

*units in API are MB, not GB

## Worker and session limits

The maximum number of concurrent workers and concurrent sessions supported for all databases in an elastic pool depends on the DTU setting for the pool: 

| DTUs | Max concurrent workers | Max concurrent sessions |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 200 | 400 | 4,800 |
| 400 | 800 | 9,600 |
| 800 | 1,600 | 19,200 |
| 1,200 | 2,400 | 28,800 |


## Azure Resource Manager limitations

An elastic pool requires an Azure SQL Database V12 server. Servers are located within a resource group.

- Each resource group can have a maximum 800 servers.
- Each server can have a maximum 800 elastic pools.
- Each elastic pool can have a maximum 100 databases.


## Latency of elastic pool operations

- Changing the guaranteed DTUs per database (databaseDtuMin) or maximum DTUs per database (databaseDtuMax) typically completes in 5 minutes or less. 
- Changing the DTU / storage limit (storageMB) of the pool depends on the total amount of space used by all databases in the pool.  Changes average 90 minutes or less per 100 GB. For example, if the total space used by all databases in the pool is 200 GB, then the expected latency for changing the pool DTU / storage limit is 3 hours or less. 



## Elastic database pool PowerShell cmdlets and REST API commands (Azure Resource Manager only)

The following PowerShell cmdlets and REST API commands are available for creating and managing elastic pools:

## Billing and pricing information

Elastic database pools are billed per the following characteristics:

- An elastic pool is billed upon its creation, even when there are no databases in the pool. 
- An elastic pool is billed hourly. This is the same metering frequency as for performance levels of standalone databases. 
- If an elastic pool is resized to a new amount of DTUs, then the pool is not billed according to the new amount of DTUS until the resizing operation completes.  This follows the same pattern as changing the performance level of standalone databases. 


- The price of an elastic pool is based on the number of DTUs of the pool, and the number of databases in the pool. 
- Price is computed by (number of pool DTUs)x(unit price per DTU) + (number of databases)x(unit price per database)

The unit DTU price for an elastic pool is higher than the unit DTU price for a standalone database in the same service tier. For details, see [SQL Database pricing](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/).
