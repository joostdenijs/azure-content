#How to Scale a Media Service  

##Overview

You can scale **Media Services** by specifying the number of **Streaming Reserved Units** and **Encoding Reserved Units** that you would like your account to be provisioned with. 

You can also scale your Media Services account by adding storage accounts to it. Each storage account is limited to 500 TB. To expand your storage beyond the default limitations, you can choose to attach multiple storage accounts to a single Media Services account.
