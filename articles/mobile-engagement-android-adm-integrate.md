#How to Integrate ADM with Engagement

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] You must follow the integration procedure described in the How to Integrate Engagement on Android document before following this guide.
>
> This document is useful only if you integrated the Reach module for any time campaign support. To integrate Reach campaigns in your application, please read first How to Integrate Engagement Reach on Android.

##Introduction

Integrating ADM allows your application to be pushed even when it's not running.

No campaign data is actually sent via ADM, it's just a background signal telling the application to fetch the Engagement push. If the application is not running while receiving an ADM push, it triggers a connection to the Engagement servers to fetch the push, the Engagement connection remains active for about a minute in case the user launches the application in the response to the push.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Only Amazon Kindle devices running Android 4.0.3 or above are supported by Amazon Device Messaging; however, you can integrate this code safely on other devices. If the application cannot be woken up by ADM, the Engagement notification will be received the next time the application is launched.

##Sign up to ADM

If not already done, you must enable ADM on your Amazon account.

The procedure is detailed at: [<https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/adm/credentials.html>].

Upon completing the procedure, you get:

-   OAuth credentials (a Client ID and a Client Secret) for Engagement to be able to push your devices.
-   An API Key that must be integrated into your application.

##SDK integration

### Managing device registrations

Each device must send a registration command to the ADM servers, otherwise they can't be reached.

If you already use the [ADM client library], and already have [integrated ADM] you can directly go to android-sdk-adm-receive.

If you have not integrated ADM yet, Engagement has a simpler way to enable it in your application:

Edit your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

-   Add the Amazon namespace, the file should begin like this:

		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
		<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
		          xmlns:amazon="http://schemas.amazon.com/apk/res/android"

-   Inside the `<application/>` tag, add this section:

		<amazon:enable-feature
		   android:name="com.amazon.device.messaging"
		   android:required="false"/>
		
		<meta-data android:name="engagement:adm:register" android:value="true" />

-   After adding the amazon tag, you may have a build error if your Project Build Target is below Android 2.1. You have to use an **Android 2.1+** build target (don't worry, you can still have a `minSdkVersion` set to 4).
-   Integrate the ADM API Key as an asset by following [this procedure].

Then follow the instructions of the next sections.

### Communicate registration id to the Engagement Push service and receive notifications

In order to communicate the registration id of the device to the Engagement Push service and receive its notifications, add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, inside the `<application/>` tag (even if you use ADM without Engagement):

		<receiver android:name="com.microsoft.azure.engagement.adm.EngagementADMEnabler"
		  android:exported="false">
		  <intent-filter>
		    <action android:name="com.microsoft.azure.engagement.intent.action.APPID_GOT"/>
		  </intent-filter>
		</receiver>
		
		 <receiver android:name="com.microsoft.azure.engagement.adm.EngagementADMReceiver"
		   android:permission="com.amazon.device.messaging.permission.SEND">
		  <intent-filter>
		    <action android:name="com.amazon.device.messaging.intent.REGISTRATION"/>
		    <action android:name="com.amazon.device.messaging.intent.RECEIVE"/>
		    <category android:name="<your_package_name>"/>
		  </intent-filter>
		</receiver>   

Ensure you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` (before the `</application>` tag).

		<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"/>
		<uses-permission android:name="com.amazon.device.messaging.permission.RECEIVE"/>
		<uses-permission android:name="<your_package_name>.permission.RECEIVE_ADM_MESSAGE"/>
		<permission android:name="<your_package_name>.permission.RECEIVE_ADM_MESSAGE" android:protectionLevel="signature"/>

##Grant Engagement OAuth credentials

Submit your OAuth Credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) at $/\#application/YOUR\_APPID/native-push.

You can now select "Any Time" when creating Reach announcements and polls.
