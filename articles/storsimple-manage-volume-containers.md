# Manage your StorSimple volume containers

## Overview

This tutorial explains how to use the StorSimple Manager service to create and manage StorSimple volume containers.

A volume container in a Microsoft Azure StorSimple device contains one or more volumes that share storage account, encryption, and bandwidth consumption settings. A device can have multiple volume containers for all its volumes. 

A volume container has the following attributes:

- **Volumes** – The thinly provisioned StorSimple volumes that are contained within the volume container. A volume container may contain up to 256 thinly provisioned StorSimple volumes.

- **Encryption** – An encryption key that can be defined for each volume container. This key is used for encrypting the data that is sent from your StorSimple device to the cloud. A military-grade AES-256 bit key is used with the user-entered key. To secure your data, we recommend that you always enable cloud storage encryption.

- **Storage account** – The storage account that is linked to your cloud storage service provider. All the volumes residing in a volume container share this storage account. You can choose a storage account from an existing list, or create a new account when you create the volume container and then specify the access credentials for that account.

- **Cloud bandwidth** – The bandwidth consumed by the device when the data from the device is being sent to the cloud. You can enforce a bandwidth control by specifying a value between 1 and 1000 Mbps when you define this container. If you want the device to consume all available bandwidth, set this field to Unlimited. You can also create and apply a bandwidth template to allocate bandwidth based on schedule.

This following procedures explain how to use the StorSimple **Volume containers** page to complete the following common operations:

- Add a volume container 
- Modify a volume container 
- Delete a volume container 

## Add a volume container

Perform the following steps to create a volume container.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-add-volume-container](../includes/storsimple-add-volume-container.md)]


## Modify a volume container

Perform the following steps to modify a volume container.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-modify-volume-container](../includes/storsimple-modify-volume-container.md)]


## Delete a volume container

A volume container has volumes within it. It can be deleted only if all the volumes contained in it are first deleted. Perform the following steps to delete a volume container.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-delete-volume-container](../includes/storsimple-delete-volume-container.md)]
