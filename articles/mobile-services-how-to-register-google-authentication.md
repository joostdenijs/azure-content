# Register your apps for Google login with Mobile Services

This topic shows you how to register your apps to be able to use Google to authenticate with Azure Mobile Services.

>[AZURE.NOTE] This tutorial is about [Azure Mobile Services](http://azure.microsoft.com/services/mobile-services/), a solution to help you build scalable mobile applications for any platform. Mobile Services makes it easy to sync data, authenticate users, and send push notifications. This page supports the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/mobile-services-ios-get-started-users/">Get Started with Authentication</a> tutorial which shows how to log users into your app. If this is your first experience with Mobile Services, please complete the tutorial <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/mobile-services-ios-get-started/">Get Started with Mobile Services</a>.

To complete the procedure in this topic, you must have a Google account that has a verified email address. To create a new Google account, go to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268302" target="_blank">accounts.google.com</a>.

1. Navigate to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268303" target="_blank">Google apis</a> website, sign-in with your Google account credentials, click **Create Project**, provide a **Project name**, then click **Create**.

2. Click **Consent screen**, select your **Email Address**, enter a **Product Name**, then click **Save**. 

3. Click **API & Auth**, click **Credentials**, then click **Create new Client ID**.

4. Select **Web application**, type your mobile service URL in **Authorized JavaScript Origins**, replace the generated URL in **Authorized Redirect URI** with the URL of your mobile service appended with the path `/login/google`, and then click **Create client ID**.

	>[AZURE.NOTE] For a .NET backend mobile service published to Azure by using Visual Studio, the redirect URL is the URL of your mobile service appended with the path _signin-google_ your mobile service as a .NET service, such as `https://todolist.azure-mobile.net/signin-google`. 

   	![](./media/mobile-services-how-to-register-google-authentication/mobile-services-google-create-client2.png)

5. Under **Client ID for web applications**, make a note of the values of **Client ID** and **Client secret**. 

   	![Client credentials](./media/mobile-services-how-to-register-google-authentication/mobile-services-google-create-client3.png)

    > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] The client secret is an important security credential. Do not share this secret with anyone or distribute it with your app.

You are now ready to use a Google login for authentication in your app by providing the client ID and client secret values to Mobile Services.
