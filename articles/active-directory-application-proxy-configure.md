# Using Application Proxy to publish applications for secure remote access

Microsoft Azure AD Application Proxy lets you publish applications, such as SharePoint sites, Outlook Web Access and IIS-based apps, inside your private network and provides secure access to users outside your network. Employees can log into your apps from home, on their own devices and authenticate through this cloud-based proxy.

Azure AD Application Proxy is a feature that is available only if you upgraded to the Premium or Basic edition of Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory editions](active-directory-editions).

> [AZURE.NOTE]
Azure Active Directory Premium and Basic editions are available for customers in China using the worldwide instance of Azure Active Directory. Azure Active Directory Premium and Basic editions are not currently supported in the Microsoft Azure service operated by 21Vianet in China. For more information, contact us at the [Azure Active Directory Forum](http://feedback.azure.com/forums/169401-azure-active-directory).
