# RemoteApp service limits and default values

This topic outlines the service limits for Azure RemoteApp.

  
## Collection limits
All collections:

- Collections per user: 1
- Published apps per collection: 5000 

Trial collections:

- Trial duration: 30 days
- Trial collections: 2 per subscription
- Trial users per collection: 10 
- Trial template images: 25
 
Activated (paid) collections:

- Paid collections: 3 (you can request an increase on this limit)
- Paid template images: 25

 
## User limits

The documented collection limits are soft limits (meaning that they can be changed). The maximum number of users per collection is a hard limit - it cannot be changed. However, the number of users you can have is determined by the tier of your collection, as follows: 


- Basic - 800 users
- Standard - 500 users

(The number of users you can support is determined by the number of VMs used for your collection. For the Basic tier, there are 16 users per VM, while the Standard tier has 10 users per VM.)

To figure out the maximum number of assigned users you can support, multiply the number of paid users per collection by the number of collections you have. 
  
You can create multiple collections in your account with these limits and go up to 5000 concurrent user connections across all collections. If you need a higher number, you can request an increase.

## Other values and limits:

- User data storage per user per collection: 50 GB
- Idle timeout: 4 hours
- Disconnected timeout: 4 hours

## How to request a limit increase
You can request an increase for collection limits and concurrent users. To do this, open a support ticket explaining what you need.
