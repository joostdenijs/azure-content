#Query DocumentDB
Microsoft Azure DocumentDB supports querying documents using SQL (Structured Query Language) over hierarchical JSON documents. DocumentDB is truly schema-free. By virtue of its commitment to the JSON data model directly within the database engine, it provides automatic indexing of JSON documents without requiring explicit schema or creation of secondary indexes. 

While designing the query language for DocumentDB we had two goals in mind:

-	<strong>Embrace SQL</strong> – Instead of inventing a new query language, we wanted to embrace SQL. After all, SQL is one of the most familiar and popular query languages. DocumentDB SQL provides a formal programming model for rich queries over JSON documents.
-	<strong>Extend SQL</strong> – As a JSON document database capable of executing JavaScript directly in the database engine, we wanted to use JavaScript's programming model as the foundation for our query language. The DocumentDB SQL is rooted in JavaScript's type system, expression evaluation, and function invocation. This in-turn provides a natural programming model for relational projections, hierarchical navigation across JSON documents, self joins, and invocation of user defined functions (UDFs) written entirely in JavaScript, among other features. 

We believe that these capabilities are key to reducing the friction between the application and the database and are crucial for developer productivity.

We recommend getting started by watching the following video, where Aravind Ramachandran shows DocumentDB's querying capabilities, and by visiting our [Query Playground](http://www.documentdb.com/sql/demo), where you can try out DocumentDB and run SQL queries against our dataset.

Then, return to this article, where we'll start by walking through some simple JSON documents and queries.

## Getting Started
To see DocumentDB SQL at work, let's begin with a few simple JSON documents and walk through some simple queries against it. Consider these two JSON documents about two families. Note that with DocumentDB, we do not need to create any schemas or secondary indices explicitly. We simply need to insert the JSON documents to a DocumentDB collection and subsequently query. 
Here we have a simple JSON document for the Andersen family, the parents, children (and their pets), address and registration information. The document has strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and nested properties. 

**Document**  

	{
	    "id": "AndersenFamily",
	    "lastName": "Andersen",
	    "parents": [
	       { "firstName": "Thomas" },
	       { "firstName": "Mary Kay"}
	    ],
	    "children": [
	       {
	           "firstName": "Henriette Thaulow", "gender": "female", "grade": 5,
	           "pets": [{ "givenName": "Fluffy" }]
	       }
	    ],
	    "address": { "state": "WA", "county": "King", "city": "seattle" },
	    "isRegistered": true
	}


Here's a second document with one subtle difference – `givenName` and `familyName` are used instead of `firstName` and `lastName`.

**Document**  

	{
	    "id": "WakefieldFamily",
	    "parents": [
	        { "familyName": "Wakefield", "givenName": "Robin" },
	        { "familyName": "Miller", "givenName": "Ben" }
	    ],
	    "children": [
	        {
	            "familyName": "Merriam", 
	             "givenName": "Jesse", 
	            "gender": "female", "grade": 1,
	            "pets": [
	                { "givenName": "Goofy" },
	                { "givenName": "Shadow" }
	            ]
	        },
	        { 
	            "familyName": "Miller", 
	             "givenName": "Lisa", 
	             "gender": "female", 
	             "grade": 8 }
	    ],
	    "address": { "state": "NY", "county": "Manhattan", "city": "NY" },
	    "isRegistered": false
	}



Now let's try a few queries against this data to understand some of the key aspects of DocumentDB SQL. For example, the following query will return the documents where the id field matches `AndersenFamily`. Since it's a `SELECT *`, the output of the query is the complete JSON document:

**Query**

	SELECT * 
	FROM Families f 
	WHERE f.id = "AndersenFamily"

**Results**

	[{
	    "id": "AndersenFamily",
	    "lastName": "Andersen",
	    "parents": [
	       { "firstName": "Thomas" },
	       { "firstName": "Mary Kay"}
	    ],
	    "children": [
	       {
	           "firstName": "Henriette Thaulow", "gender": "female", "grade": 5,
	           "pets": [{ "givenName": "Fluffy" }]
	       }
	    ],
	    "address": { "state": "WA", "county": "King", "city": "seattle" },
	    "isRegistered": true
	}]


Now consider the case where we need to reformat the JSON output in a different shape. This query projects a new JSON object with two selected fields, Name and City, when the address' city has the same name as the state. In this case, "NY, NY" matches.

**Query**	

	SELECT {"Name":f.id, "City":f.address.city} AS Family 
	FROM Families f 
	WHERE f.address.city = f.address.state

**Results**

	[{
	    "Family": {
	        "Name": "WakefieldFamily", 
	        "City": "NY"
	    }
	}]


The next query returns all the given names of children in the family whose id matches `WakefieldFamily`.

**Query**

	SELECT c.givenName 
	FROM Families f 
	JOIN c IN f.children 
	WHERE f.id = 'WakefieldFamily'

**Results**

	[
	  { "givenName": "Jesse" }, 
	  { "givenName": "Lisa"}
	]


We would like to draw attention to a few noteworthy aspects of the DocumentDB query language through the examples we've seen so far:  
 
-	Since DocumentDB SQL works on JSON values, it deals with tree shaped entities instead of rows and columns. Therefore, the language lets you refer to nodes of the tree at any arbitrary depth, like `Node1.Node2.Node3…..Nodem`, similar to relational SQL referring to the two part reference of `<table>.<column>`.   
-	The language works with schema-less data. Therefore, the type system needs to be bound dynamically. The same expression could yield different types on different documents. The result of a query is a valid JSON value, but is not guaranteed to be of a fixed schema.  
-	DocumentDB only supports strict JSON documents. This means the type system and expressions are restricted to deal only with JSON types. Please refer to the [JSON specification](http://www.json.org/) for more details.  
-	A DocumentDB collection is a schema-free container of JSON documents. The relations in data entities within and across documents in a collection are implicitly captured by containment and not by primary key and foreign key relations. This is an important aspect worth pointing out in light of the intra-document joins discussed later in this article.

##DocumentDB Indexing

Before we get into the DocumentDB SQL grammar, it is worth exploring the indexing design in DocumentDB. 

The purpose of database indexes is to serve queries in their various forms and shapes with minimum resource consumption (like CPU and input/output) while providing good throughput and low latency. Often, the choice of the right index for querying a database requires much planning and experimentation. This approach poses a challenge for schema-less databases where the data doesn’t conform to a strict schema and evolves rapidly. 

Therefore, when we designed the DocumentDB indexing subsystem, we set the following goals:

-	Index documents without requiring schema: The indexing subsystem does not require any schema information or make any assumptions about schema of the documents. 

-	Support for efficient, rich hierarchical, and relational queries: The index supports the DocumentDB query language efficiently, including support for hierarchical and relational projections.

-	Support for consistent queries in face of a sustained volume of writes: For high write throughput workloads with consistent queries, the index is updated incrementally, efficiently, and online in the face of a sustained volume of writes. The consistent index update is crucial to serve the queries at the consistency level in which the user configured the document service.

-	Support for multi-tenancy: Given the reservation based model for resource governance across tenants, index updates are performed within the budget of system resources (CPU, memory, and input/output operations per second) allocated per replica. 

-	Storage efficiency: For cost effectiveness, the on-disk storage overhead of the index is bounded and predictable. This is crucial because DocumentDB allows the developer to make cost based tradeoffs between index overhead in relation to the query performance.  

Refer to the [DocumentDB samples](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Azure-DocumentDB-NET-Code-6b3da8af#content) on MSDN for samples showing how to configure the indexing policy for a collection. Let’s now get into the details of the DocumentDB SQL grammar.


##Basics of DocumentDB Query
Every query consists of a SELECT clause and optional FROM and WHERE clauses per ANSI-SQL standards. Typically, for each query, the source in the FROM clause is enumerated. Then the filter in the WHERE clause is applied on the source to retrieve a subset of JSON documents. Finally, the SELECT clause is used to project the requested JSON values in the select list.
    
    SELECT <select_list> 
    [FROM <from_specification>] 
    [WHERE <filter_condition>]    


##FROM Clause
The `FROM <from_specification>` clause is optional unless the source is filtered or projected later in the query. The purpose of this clause is to specify the data source upon which the query must operate. Commonly the whole collection is the source, but one can specify a subset of the collection instead. 

A query like `SELECT * FROM Families` indicates that the entire Families collection is the source over which to enumerate. A special identifier ROOT can be used to represent the collection instead of using the collection name. 
The following list contains the rules that are enforced per query:

- The collection can be aliased, such as `SELECT f.id FROM Families AS f` or simply `SELECT f.id FROM Families f`. Here `f` is the equivalent of `Families`. `AS` is an optional keyword to alias the identifier.

-	Note that once aliased, the original source cannot be bound. For example, `SELECT Familes.id FROM Families f` is syntactically invalid since the identifier "Families" cannot be resolved anymore.

-	All properties that need to be referenced must be fully qualified. In the absence of strict schema adherence, this is enforced to avoid any ambiguous bindings. Therefore, `SELECT id FROM Families f` is syntactically invalid since the property `id` is not bound.
	
###Sub-documents
The source can also be reduced to a smaller subset. For instance, to enumerating only a sub-tree in each document, the sub-root could then become the source, as shown in the following example.

**Query**

	SELECT * 
	FROM Families.children

**Results**  

	[
	  [
	    {
	        "firstName": "Henriette Thaulow",
	        "gender": "female",
	        "grade": 5,
	        "pets": [
	          {
	              "givenName": "Fluffy"
	          }
	        ]
	    }
	  ],
	  [
	    {
	        "familyName": "Merriam",
	        "givenName": "Jesse",
	        "gender": "female",
	        "grade": 1
	    },
	    {
	        "familyName": "Miller",
	        "givenName": "Lisa",
	        "gender": "female",
	        "grade": 8
	    }
	  ]
	]

While the above example used an array as the source, an object could also be used as the source, which is what's shown in the following example. Any valid JSON value (not undefined) that can be found in the source will be considered for inclusion in the result of the query. If some families don’t have an `address.state` value, they will be excluded in the query result.

**Query**

	SELECT * 
	FROM Families.address.state

**Results**

	[
	  "WA", 
	  "NY"
	]


##WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause (**`WHERE <filter_condition>`**) is optional. It specifies the condition(s) that the JSON documents provided by the source must satisfy in order to be included as part of the result. Any JSON document must evaluate the specified conditions to "true" to be considered for the result. The WHERE clause is used by the index layer in order to determine the absolute smallest subset of source documents that can be part of the result. 

The following query requests documents that contain a name property whose value is `AndersenFamily`. Any other document that does not have a name property, or where the value does not match `AndersenFamily` is excluded. 

**Query**

	SELECT f.address
	FROM Families f 
	WHERE f.id = "AndersenFamily"

**Results**

	[{
	  "address": {
	    "state": "WA", 
	    "county": "King", 
	    "city": "seattle"
	  }
	}]


The previous example showed a simple equality query. DocumentDB SQL also supports a variety of scalar expressions. The most commonly used are binary and unary expressions. Property references from the source JSON object are also valid expressions. 

The following binary operators are currently supported and can be used in queries as shown in the following examples:  
<table>
<tr>
<td>Arithmetic</td>	
<td>+,-,*,/,%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bitwise</td>	
<td>|, &, ^, <<, >>, >>> (zero-fill right shift) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Logical</td>
<td>AND, OR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Comparison</td>	
<td>=, !=, >, >=, <, <=, <></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>String</td>	
<td>|| (concatenate)</td>
</tr>
</table>  

Let’s take a look at some queries using binary operators.

	SELECT * 
	FROM Families.children[0] c
	WHERE c.grade % 2 = 1     -- matching grades == 5, 1
	
	SELECT * 
	FROM Families.children[0] c
	WHERE c.grade ^ 4 = 1    -- matching grades == 5
	
	SELECT *
	FROM Families.children[0] c
	WHERE c.grade >= 5     -- matching grades == 5


The unary operators +,-, ~ and NOT are also supported, and can be used inside queries as shown in the following example:

	SELECT *
	FROM Families.children[0] c
	WHERE NOT(c.grade = 5)  -- matching grades == 1
	
	SELECT *
	FROM Families.children[0] c
	WHERE (-c.grade = -5)  -- matching grades == 5



In addition to binary and unary operators, property references are also allowed. For example, `SELECT * FROM Families f WHERE f.isRegistered` returns the JSON document containing the property `isRegistered` where the property's value is equal to the JSON `true` value. Any other values (false, null, Undefined, `<number>`, `<string>`, `<object>`, `<array>`, etc.) leads to the source document being excluded from the result. 

###Equality and Comparison operators
The following table shows the result of equality comparisons in DocumentDB SQL between any two JSON types.

   </tbody>
</table>

For other comparison operators such as >, >=, !=, < and <=, the following rules apply:   

-	Comparison across types results in Undefined.
-	Comparison between two objects or two arrays results in Undefined.   

If the result of the scalar expression in the filter is Undefined, the corresponding document would not be included in the result, since Undefined doesn't logically equate to "true".

###BETWEEN keyword
You can also use the BETWEEN keyword to express queries against ranges of values like in ANSI SQL. BETWEEN can be used against any JSON primitive type (numbers, strings, Booleans and nulls). 

For example, this query returns all family documents in which the first child's grade is between 1-5 (both inclusive). 

    SELECT *
    FROM Families.children[0] c
    WHERE c.grade BETWEEN 1 AND 5

Unlike in ANSI-SQL, you can also use the BETWEEN clause in the FROM clause like in the following example.

    SELECT (c.grade BETWEEN 0 AND 10)
    FROM Families.children[0] c

For faster query execution times, remember to create an indexing policy that uses a range index type against any numeric properties/paths that are filtered in the BETWEEN clause. 

The main difference between using BETWEEN in DocumentDB and ANSI SQL is that you can express range queries against properties of mixed types – for example, you might have "grade" be a number (5) in some documents and strings in others ("grade4"). In these cases, like in JavaScript, a comparison between two different types results in "undefined", and the document will be skipped.

###Logical (AND, OR and NOT) operators
Logical operators operate on Boolean values. The logical truth tables for these operators are shown in the following tables.

<table style = "width:300px">
    <tbody>
        <tr>

###IN keyword
The IN keyword can be used to check whether a specified value matches any value in a list. For example, this query returns all family documents where the id is one of "WakefieldFamily" or "AndersenFamily". 
 
    SELECT *
    FROM Families 
    WHERE Families.id IN ('AndersenFamily', 'WakefieldFamily')

This example returns all documents where the state is any of the specified values.

    SELECT *
    FROM Families 
    WHERE Families.address.state IN ("NY", "WA", "CA", "PA", "OH", "OR", "MI", "WI", "MN", "FL")

IN is equivalent to chaining multiple OR clauses, however since it can be served using a single index, DocumentDB supports a higher [limit](documentdb-limits.md) for the number of arguments specified within an IN clause.  

###Ternary (?) and Coalesce (??) operators:
The Ternary and Coalesce operators can be used to build conditional expressions, similar to popular programming languages like C# and JavaScript. 

The Ternary (?) operator can be very handy when constructing new JSON properties on the fly. For example, now you can write queries to classify the class levels into a human readable form like Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced as shown below.
 
     SELECT (c.grade < 5)? "elementary": "other" AS gradeLevel 
     FROM Families.children[0] c

You can also nest the calls to the operator like in the query below.
 
    SELECT (c.grade < 5)? "elementary": ((c.grade < 9)? "junior": "high")  AS gradeLevel 
    FROM Families.children[0] c

As with other query operators, if the referenced properties in the conditional expression are missing in any document, or if the types being compared are different, then those documents will be excluded in the query results.

The Coalesce (??) operator can be used to efficiently check for the presence of a property (a.k.a. is defined) in a document. This is useful when querying against semi-structured or data of mixed types. For example, this query returns the "lastName" if present, or the "surname" if it isn't present.

    SELECT f.lastName ?? f.surname AS familyName
    FROM Families f

Similarly, you can also query for the absence of a property ("undefined") like in the following example.

    SELECT *
    FROM classes c
    WHERE c.lastName ?? true

##SELECT Clause
The SELECT clause (**`SELECT <select_list>`**) is mandatory and specifies what values will be retrieved from the query, just like in ANSI-SQL. The subset that's been filtered on top of the source documents are passed onto the projection phase, where the specified JSON values are retrieved and a new JSON object is constructed, for each input passed onto it. 

The following example shows a typical SELECT query. 

**Query**

	SELECT f.address
	FROM Families f 
	WHERE f.id = "AndersenFamily"

**Results**

	[{
	  "address": {
	    "state": "WA", 
	    "county": "King", 
	    "city": "seattle"
	  }
	}]


###Nested Properties
In the following example, we are projecting two nested properties `f.address.state` and `f.address.city`.

**Query**

	SELECT f.address.state, f.address.city
	FROM Families f 
	WHERE f.id = "AndersenFamily"

**Results**

	[{
	  "state": "WA", 
	  "city": "seattle"
	}]


Projection also supports JSON expressions as shown in the following example.

**Query**

	SELECT { "state": f.address.state, "city": f.address.city, "name": f.id }
	FROM Families f 
	WHERE f.id = "AndersenFamily"

**Results**

	[{
	  "$1": {
	    "state": "WA", 
	    "city": "seattle", 
	    "name": "AndersenFamily"
	  }
	}]


Let's look at the role of `$1` here. The `SELECT` clause needs to create a JSON object and since no key is provided, we use implicit argument variable names starting with `$1`. For example, this query returns two implicit argument variables, labeled `$1` and `$2`.

**Query**

	SELECT { "state": f.address.state, "city": f.address.city }, 
	       { "name": f.id }
	FROM Families f 
	WHERE f.id = "AndersenFamily"

**Results**

	[{
	  "$1": {
	    "state": "WA", 
	    "city": "seattle"
	  }, 
	  "$2": {
	    "name": "AndersenFamily"
	  }
	}]


###Aliasing
Now let's extend the example above with explicit aliasing of values. AS is the keyword used for aliasing. Note that it's optional as shown while projecting the second value as `NameInfo`. 

In case a query has two properties with the same name, aliasing must be used to rename one or both of the properties so that they are disambiguated in the projected result.

**Query**

	SELECT 
	       { "state": f.address.state, "city": f.address.city } AS AddressInfo, 
	       { "name": f.id } NameInfo
	FROM Families f 
	WHERE f.id = "AndersenFamily"

**Results**

	[{
	  "AddressInfo": {
	    "state": "WA", 
	    "city": "seattle"
	  }, 
	  "NameInfo": {
	    "name": "AndersenFamily"
	  }
	}]


###Scalar Expressions
In addition to property references, the SELECT clause also supports scalar expressions like constants, arithmetic expressions, logical expressions, etc. For example, here's a simple "Hello World" query.

**Query**

	SELECT "Hello World"

**Results**

	[{
	  "$1": "Hello World"
	}]


Here's a more complex example that uses a scalar expression.

**Query**

	SELECT ((2 + 11 % 7)-2)/3	

**Results**

	[{
	  "$1": 1.33333
	}]


In the following example, the result of the scalar expression is a Boolean.

**Query**

	SELECT f.address.city = f.address.state AS AreFromSameCityState
	FROM Families f	

**Results**

	[
	  {
	    "AreFromSameCityState": false
	  }, 
	  {
	    "AreFromSameCityState": true
	  }
	]


###Object and Array Creation
Another key feature of DocumentDB SQL is array/object creation. In the previous example, note that we created a new JSON object. Similarly, one can also construct arrays as shown in the following examples.

**Query**

	SELECT [f.address.city, f.address.state] AS CityState 
	FROM Families f	

**Results**  

	[
	  {
	    "CityState": [
	      "seattle", 
	      "WA"
	    ]
	  }, 
	  {
	    "CityState": [
	      "NY", 
	      "NY"
	    ]
	  }
	]

###VALUE keyword
The **VALUE** keyword provides a way to return JSON value. For example, the query shown below returns the scalar `"Hello World"` instead of `{$1: "Hello World"}`.

**Query**

	SELECT VALUE "Hello World"

**Results**

	[
	  "Hello World"
	]


The following query returns the JSON value without the `"address"` label in the results.

**Query**

	SELECT VALUE f.address
	FROM Families f	

**Results**  

	[
	  {
	    "state": "WA", 
	    "county": "King", 
	    "city": "seattle"
	  }, 
	  {
	    "state": "NY", 
	    "county": "Manhattan", 
	    "city": "NY"
	  }
	]

The following example extends this to show how to return JSON primitive values (the leaf level of the JSON tree). 

**Query**

	SELECT VALUE f.address.state
	FROM Families f	

**Results**

	[
	  "WA",
	  "NY"
	]


###* Operator
The special operator (*) is supported to project the document as-is. When used, it must be the only projected field. While a query like `SELECT * FROM Families f` is valid, `SELECT VALUE * FROM Families f ` and  `SELECT *, f.id FROM Families f ` are not valid.

**Query**

	SELECT * 
	FROM Families f 
	WHERE f.id = "AndersenFamily"

**Results**

	[{
	    "id": "AndersenFamily",
	    "lastName": "Andersen",
	    "parents": [
	       { "firstName": "Thomas" },
	       { "firstName": "Mary Kay"}
	    ],
	    "children": [
	       {
	           "firstName": "Henriette Thaulow", "gender": "female", "grade": 5,
	           "pets": [{ "givenName": "Fluffy" }]
	       }
	    ],
	    "address": { "state": "WA", "county": "King", "city": "seattle" },
	    "isRegistered": true
	}]

##Advanced Concepts
###Iteration
A new construct was added via the **IN** keyword in DocumentDB SQL to provide support for iterating over JSON arrays. The FROM source provides support for iteration. Let's start with the following example:

**Query**

	SELECT * 
	FROM Families.children

**Results**  

	[
	  [
	    {
	      "firstName": "Henriette Thaulow", 
	      "gender": "female", 
	      "grade": 5, 
	      "pets": [{ "givenName": "Fluffy"}]
	    }
	  ], 
	  [
	    {
	        "familyName": "Merriam", 
	        "givenName": "Jesse", 
	        "gender": "female", 
	        "grade": 1
	    }, 
	    {
	        "familyName": "Miller", 
	        "givenName": "Lisa", 
	        "gender": "female", 
	        "grade": 8
	    }
	  ]
	]

Now let's look at another query that performs iteration over children in the collection. Note the difference in the output array. This example splits `children` and flattens the results into a single array.  

**Query**

	SELECT * 
	FROM c IN Families.children

**Results**  

	[
	  {
	      "firstName": "Henriette Thaulow",
	      "gender": "female",
	      "grade": 5,
	      "pets": [{ "givenName": "Fluffy" }]
	  },
	  {
	      "familyName": "Merriam",
	      "givenName": "Jesse",
	      "gender": "female",
	      "grade": 1
	  },
	  {
	      "familyName": "Miller",
	      "givenName": "Lisa",
	      "gender": "female",
	      "grade": 8
	  }
	]

This can be further used to filter on each individual entry of the array as shown in the following example.

**Query**

	SELECT c.givenName
	FROM c IN Families.children
	WHERE c.grade = 8

**Results**  

	[{
	  "givenName": "Lisa"
	}]

###Joins
In a relational database, the need to join across tables is very important. It's the logical corollary to designing normalized schemas. Contrary to this, DocumentDB deals with the denormalized data model of schema-free documents. This is the logical equivalent of a "self-join".

The syntax that the language supports is <from_source1> JOIN <from_source2> JOIN ... JOIN <from_sourceN>. Overall, this returns a set of **N**-tuples (tuple with **N** values). Each tuple has values produced by iterating all collection aliases over their respective sets. In other words, this is a full cross product of the sets participating in the join.

The following examples show how the JOIN clause works. In the following example, the result is empty since the cross product of each document from source and an empty set is empty.

**Query**

	SELECT f.id
	FROM Families f
	JOIN f.NonExistent

**Results**  

	[{
	}]


In the following example, the join is between the document root and the `children` sub-root. It's a cross product between two JSON objects. The fact that children is an array is not effective in the JOIN since we are dealing with a single root that is the children array. Hence the result contains only two results, since the cross product of each document with the array yields exactly only one document.

**Query**

	SELECT f.id
	FROM Families f
	JOIN f.children
 
**Results**

	[
	  {
	    "id": "AndersenFamily"
	  }, 
	  {
	    "id": "WakefieldFamily"
	  }
	]


The following example shows a more conventional join:

**Query**

	SELECT f.id
	FROM Families f
	JOIN c IN f.children 

**Results**

	[
	  {
	    "id": "AndersenFamily"
	  }, 
	  {
	    "id": "WakefieldFamily"
	  }, 
	  {
	    "id": "WakefieldFamily"
	  }
	]



The first thing to note is that the `from_source` of the **JOIN** clause is an iterator. So, the flow in this case is as follows:  

-	Expand each child element **c** in the array.
-	Apply a cross product with the root of the document **f** with each child element **c** that was flattened in the first step.
-	Finally, project the root object **f** name property alone. 

The first document (`AndersenFamily`) contains only one child element, so the result set contains only a single object corresponding to this document. The second document (`WakefieldFamily`) contains two children. So, the cross product produces a separate object for each child, thereby resulting in two objects, one for each child corresponding to this document. Note that the root fields in both these documents will be same, just as you would expect in a cross product.

The real utility of the JOIN is to form tuples from the cross-product in a shape that's otherwise difficult to project. Furthermore, as we will see in the example below, you could filter on the combination of a tuple that lets' the user chose a condition satisfied by the tuples overall.

**Query**

	SELECT 
		f.id AS familyName,
		c.givenName AS childGivenName,
		c.firstName AS childFirstName,
		p.givenName AS petName 
	FROM Families f 
	JOIN c IN f.children 
	JOIN p IN c.pets
 
**Results**

	[
	  {
	    "familyName": "AndersenFamily", 
	    "childFirstName": "Henriette Thaulow", 
	    "petName": "Fluffy"
	  }, 
	  {
	    "familyName": "WakefieldFamily", 
	    "childGivenName": "Jesse", 
	    "petName": "Goofy"
	  }, 
	  {
	   "familyName": "WakefieldFamily", 
	   "childGivenName": "Jesse", 
	   "petName": "Shadow"
	  }
	]



This example is a natural extension of the preceding example, and performs a double join. So, the cross product can be viewed as the following pseudo-code.

	for-each(Family f in Families)
	{	
		for-each(Child c in f.children)
		{
			for-each(Pet p in c.pets)
			{
				return (Tuple(f.id AS familyName, 
	              c.givenName AS childGivenName, 
	              c.firstName AS childFirstName,
	              p.givenName AS petName));
			}
		}
	}

`AndersenFamily` has one child who has one pet. So, the cross product yields one row (1*1*1) from this family. WakefieldFamily however has two children, but only one child "Jesse" has pets. Jesse has 2 pets though. Hence the cross product yields 1*1*2 = 2 rows from this family.

In the next example, there is an additional filter on `pet`. This excludes all the tuples where the pet name is not "Shadow". Notice that we are able to build tuples from arrays, filter on any of the elements of the tuple, and project any combination of the elements. 

**Query**

	SELECT 
		f.id AS familyName,
		c.givenName AS childGivenName,
		c.firstName AS childFirstName,
		p.givenName AS petName 
	FROM Families f 
	JOIN c IN f.children 
	JOIN p IN c.pets
	WHERE p.givenName = "Shadow"

**Results**

	[
	  {
	   "familyName": "WakefieldFamily", 
	   "childGivenName": "Jesse", 
	   "petName": "Shadow"
	  }
	]


##JavaScript Integration
DocumentDB provides a programming model for executing JavaScript based application logic directly on the collections in terms of stored procedures and triggers. This allows for both:

-	Ability to do high performance transactional CRUD operations and queries against documents in a collection by virtue of the deep integration of JavaScript runtime directly within the database engine. 
-	A natural modeling of control flow, variable scoping, and assignment and integration of exception handling primitives with database transactions. For more details about DocumentDB support for JavaScript integration, please refer to the JavaScript server side programmability documentation.

###User Defined Functions (UDFs)
Along with the types already defined in this article, DocumentDB SQL provides support for User Defined Functions (UDF). In particular, scalar UDFs are supported where the developers can pass in zero or many arguments and return a single argument result back. Each of these arguments are checked for being legal JSON values.  

The DocumentDB SQL grammar is extended to support custom application logic using these User Defined Functions. UDFs can be registered with DocumentDB and then be referenced as part of a SQL query. In fact, the UDFs are exquisitely designed to be invoked by queries. As a corollary to this choice, UDFs do not have access to the context object which the other JavaScript types (stored procedures and triggers) have. Since queries execute as read-only, they can run either on primary or on secondary replicas. Therefore, UDFs are designed to run on secondary replicas unlike other JavaScript types.

Below is an example of how a UDF can be registered at the DocumentDB database, specifically under a document collection.

   
	   UserDefinedFunction sqrtUdf = new UserDefinedFunction
	   {
	       Id = "SQRT",
	       Body = @"function(number) { 
	                   return Math.sqrt(number);
	               };",
	   };
	   UserDefinedFunction createdUdf = client.CreateUserDefinedFunctionAsync(
	       collectionSelfLink/* link of the parent collection*/, 
	       sqrtUdf).Result;  
                                                                             
The preceding example creates a UDF whose name is `SQRT`. It accepts a single JSON value `number` and calculates the square root of the number using the Math library.


We can now use this UDF in a query in a projection. UDFs must be qualified with the case-sensitive prefix "udf." when called from within queries. 

>[AZURE.NOTE] Prior to 3/17/2015, DocumentDB supported UDF calls without the "udf." prefix like SELECT SQRT(5). This calling pattern has been deprecated.  

**Query**

	SELECT udf.SQRT(c.grade)
	FROM c IN Families.children

**Results**

	[
	  {
	    "$1": 2.23606797749979
	  }, 
	  {
	    "$1": 1
	  }, 
	  {
	    "$1": 2.8284271247461903
	  }
	]

The UDF can also be used inside a filter as shown in the example below, also qualified with the "udf." prefix :

**Query**

	SELECT c.grade
	FROM c IN Familes.children
	WHERE udf.SQRT(c.grade) = 1

**Results**

	[{
	    "grade": 1
	}]


In essence, UDFs are valid scalar expressions and can be used in both projections and filters. 

To expand on the power of UDFs, let's look at another example with conditional logic:

	   UserDefinedFunction seaLevelUdf = new UserDefinedFunction()
	   {
	       Id = "SEALEVEL",
	       Body = @"function(city) {
	       		switch (city) {
	       		    case 'seattle':
	       		        return 520;
	       		    case 'NY':
	       		        return 410;
	       		    case 'Chicago':
	       		        return 673;
	       		    default:
	       		        return -1;
	                }"
            };

            UserDefinedFunction createdUdf = await client.CreateUserDefinedFunctionAsync(collection.SelfLink, seaLevelUdf);
	
	
Below is an example that exercises the UDF.

**Query**

	SELECT f.address.city, udf.SEALEVEL(f.address.city) AS seaLevel
	FROM Families f	

**Results**

	 [
	  {
	    "city": "seattle", 
	    "seaLevel": 520
	  }, 
	  {
	    "city": "NY", 
	    "seaLevel": 410
	  }
	]


As the preceding examples showcase, UDFs integrate the power of JavaScript language with the DocumentDB SQL to provide a rich programmable interface to do complex procedural, conditional logic with the help of inbuilt JavaScript runtime capabilities.

DocumentDB SQL provides the arguments to the UDFs for each document in the source at the current stage (WHERE clause or SELECT clause) of processing the UDF. The result is incorporated in the overall execution pipeline seamlessly. If the properties referred to by the UDF parameters are not available in the JSON value, the parameter is considered as undefined and hence the UDF invocation is entirely skipped. Similarly if the result of the UDF is undefined, it's not included in the result. 

In summary, UDFs are great tools to do complex business logic as part of the query.

###Operator Evaluation
DocumentDB, by the virtue of being a JSON database, draws parallels with JavaScript operators and its evaluation semantics. While DocumentDB tries to preserve JavaScript semantics in terms of JSON support, the operation evaluation deviates in some instances.

In DocumentDB SQL, unlike in traditional SQL, the types of values are often not known until the values are actually retrieved from database. In order to efficiently execute queries, most of the operators have strict type requirements. 

DocumentDB SQL doesn't perform implicit conversions, unlike JavaScript. For instance, a query like `SELECT * FROM Person p WHERE p.Age = 21` matches documents which contain an Age property whose value is 21. Any other document whose Age property matches string "21", or
other possibly infinite variations like "021", "21.0", "0021", "00021", etc. will not be matched. 
This is in contrast to the JavaScript where the string values are implicitly casted to numbers (based on operator, ex: ==). This choice is crucial for efficient index matching in DocumentDB SQL. 

##Parameterized SQL
DocumentDB supports queries with parameters expressed with the familiar @ notation. Parameterized SQL provides robust handling and escaping of user input, preventing accidental exposure of data through SQL injection. 

For example, you can write a query that takes last name and address state as parameters, and then execute it for various values of last name and address state based on user input.

    SELECT * 
    FROM Families f
    WHERE f.lastName = @lastName AND f.address.state = @addressState

This request can then be sent to DocumentDB as a parameterized JSON query like shown below.

    {      
        "query": "SELECT * FROM Families f WHERE f.lastName = @lastName AND f.address.state = @addressState",     
        "parameters": [          
            {"name": "@lastName", "value": "Wakefield"},         
            {"name": "@addressState", "value": "NY"},           
        ] 
    }

Parameter values can be any valid JSON (strings, numbers, Booleans, null, even arrays or nested JSON). Also since DocumentDB is schema-less, parameters are not validated against any type.

##Built-in functions
DocumentDB also supports a number of built-in functions for common operations, that can be used inside queries like user defined functions (UDFs).

<table>
<tr>
<td>Mathematical Functions</td>	
<td>ABS, CEILING, EXP, FLOOR, LOG, LOG10, POWER, ROUND, SIGN, SQRT, SQUARE, TRUNC, ACOS, ASIN, ATAN, ATN2, COS, COT, DEGREES, PI, RADIANS, SIN, and TAN</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Type checking functions</td>	
<td>IS_ARRAY, IS_BOOL, IS_NULL, IS_NUMBER, IS_OBJECT, IS_STRING, IS_DEFINED, and IS_PRIMITIVE</td>

<td>CONCAT, CONTAINS, ENDSWITH, INDEX_OF, LEFT, LENGTH, LOWER, LTRIM, REPLACE, REPLICATE, REVERSE, RIGHT, RTRIM, STARTSWITH, SUBSTRING, and UPPER</td>
</tr>
<td>Array functions</td>	
<td>ARRAY_CONCAT, ARRAY_CONTAINS, ARRAY_LENGTH, and ARRAY_SLICE</td>
</tr>
</table>  

If you’re currently using a user defined function (UDF) for which a built-in function is now available, you should use the corresponding built-in function as it is going to be quicker to run and more efficiently. 

###Mathematical functions
The mathematical functions each perform a calculation, usually based on input values that are provided as arguments, and return a numeric value. Here’s a table of supported built-in mathematical functions.

</table> 

For example, you can now run queries like the following:

**Query**

    SELECT VALUE ABS(-4)

**Results**

    [4]

The main difference between DocumentDB’s functions compared to ANSI SQL is that they are designed to work well with schema-less and mixed schema data. For example, if you have a document where the Size property is missing, or has a non-numeric value like “unknown”, then the document is skipped over, instead of returning an error.

###Type checking Functions
The type checking functions allow you to check the type of an expression within SQL queries. Type checking functions can be used to determine the type of properties within documents on the fly when it is variable or unknown. Here’s a table of supported built-in type checking functions.

<table>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Usage</strong></td>
  <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn782250.aspx#bk_is_array">IS_ARRAY (expr)</a></td>
  <td>Returns a Boolean indicating if the type of the value is an array.</td>
</tr>

  <td><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn782250.aspx#bk_is_bool">IS_BOOL (expr)</a></td>
  <td>Returns a Boolean indicating if the type of the value is a Boolean.</td>

</tr>

</table>

Using these functions, you can now run queries like the following:

**Query**

    SELECT VALUE IS_NUMBER(-4)

**Results**

    [true]

###String Functions
The following scalar functions perform an operation on a string input value and return a string, numeric or Boolean value. Here's a table of built-in string functions:

<table>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Usage</strong></td>
  <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>LENGTH (str_expr)</a></td>
  <td>Returns the number of characters of the specified string expression.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>CONCAT (str_expr, str_expr [, str_expr])</a></td>
  <td>Returns a string that is the result of concatenating two or more string values.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>SUBSTRING (str_expr, num_expr, num_expr)</a></td>
  <td>Returns part of a string expression.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>STARTSWITH (str_expr, str_expr)</a></td>
  <td>Returns a Boolean indicating whether the first string expression ends with the second</td>

  <td>RTRIM (str_expr)</a></td>
  <td>Returns a string expression after truncating all trailing blanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>LOWER (str_expr)</a></td>
  <td>Returns a string expression after converting uppercase character data to lowercase.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>UPPER (str_expr)</a></td>
  <td>Returns a string expression after converting lowercase character data to uppercase.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>REPLACE (str_expr, str_expr, str_expr)</a></td>
  <td>Replaces all occurrences of a specified string value with another string value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>REPLICATE (str_expr, num_expr)</a></td>
  <td>Repeats a string value a specified number of times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>REVERSE (str_expr)</a></td>
  <td>Returns the reverse order of a string value.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Using these functions, you can now run queries like the following. For example, you can return the family name in uppercase as follows:

**Query**

    SELECT VALUE UPPER(Families.id)
    FROM Families

**Results**

    [
        "WAKEFIELDFAMILY", 
        "ANDERSENFAMILY"
    ]

Or concatenate strings like in this example:

**Query**

    SELECT Families.id, CONCAT(Families.address.city, ",", Families.address.state) AS location
    FROM Families

**Results**

    [{
      "id": "WakefieldFamily",
      "location": "NY,NY"
    },
    {
      "id": "AndersenFamily",
      "location": "seattle,WA"
    }]


String functions can also be used in the WHERE clause to filter results, like in the following example:

**Query**

    SELECT Families.id, Families.address.city
    FROM Families
    WHERE STARTSWITH(Families.id, "Wakefield")

**Results**

    [{
      "id": "WakefieldFamily",
      "city": "NY"
    }]

###Array Functions
The following scalar functions perform an operation on an array input value and return numeric, Boolean or array value. Here's a table of built-in array functions:

<table>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Usage</strong></td>
  <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>ARRAY_LENGTH (arr_expr)</a></td>
  <td>Returns the number of elements of the specified array expression.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>ARRAY_CONCAT (arr_expr, arr_expr [, arr_expr])</a></td>
  <td>Returns an array that is the result of concatenating two or more array values.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>ARRAY_CONTAINS (arr_expr, expr)</a></td>
  <td>Returns a Boolean indicating whether the array contains the specified value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>ARRAY_SLICE (arr_expr, num_expr [, num_expr])</a></td>
  <td>Returns part of an array expression.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Array functions can be used to manipulate arrays within JSON. For example, here's a query that returns all documents where one of the parents is "Robin Wakefield". 

**Query**

    SELECT Families.id 
    FROM Families 
    WHERE ARRAY_CONTAINS(Families.parents, { givenName: "Robin", familyName: "Wakefield" })

**Results**

    [{
      "id": "WakefieldFamily"
    }]

Here's another example that uses ARRAY_LENGTH to get the number of children per family.

**Query**

    SELECT Families.id, ARRAY_LENGTH(Families.children) AS numberOfChildren
    FROM Families 

**Results**

    [{
      "id": "WakefieldFamily",
      "numberOfChildren": 2
    },
    {
      "id": "AndersenFamily",
      "numberOfChildren": 1
    }]

That wraps up built-in functions, and the SQL grammar for DocumentDB. Now let's take a look at how LINQ querying works and how it interacts with the grammar we've seen so far.


##LINQ to DocumentDB SQL
LINQ is a .NET programming model that expresses computation as queries on streams of objects. DocumentDB provides a client side library to interface with LINQ by facilitating a conversion between JSON and .NET objects and a mapping from a subset of LINQ queries to DocumentDB queries. 

The picture below shows the architecture of supporting LINQ queries using DocumentDB.  Using the DocumentDB client, developers can create an **IQueryable** object that directly queries the DocumentDB query provider, which then translates the LINQ query into a DocumentDB query. The query is then passed to the DocumentDB server to retrieve a set of results in JSON format. The returned results are deserialized into a stream of .NET objects on the client side.

###.NET and JSON Mapping
The mapping between .NET objects and JSON documents is natural - each data member field is mapped to a JSON object, where the field name is mapped to the "key" part of the object and the "value" part is recursively mapped to the value part of the object. Consider the following example. The Family object created is mapped to the JSON document as shown below. And vice versa, the JSON document is mapped back to a .NET object.

**C# Class**

	public class Family
	{
	    [JsonProperty(PropertyName="id")]
	    public string Id;
	    public Parent[] parents;
	    public Child[] children;
	    public bool isRegistered;
	};
	
	public struct Parent
	{
	    public string familyName;
	    public string givenName;
	};
	
	public class Child
	{
	    public string familyName;
	    public string givenName;
	    public string gender;
	    public int grade;
	    public List<Pet> pets;
	};
	
	public class Pet
	{
	    public string givenName;
	};
	
	public class Address
	{
	    public string state;
	    public string county;
	    public string city;
	};
	
	// Create a Family object.
	Parent mother = new Parent { familyName= "Wakefield", givenName="Robin" };
	Parent father = new Parent { familyName = "Miller", givenName = "Ben" };
	Child child = new Child { familyName="Merriam", givenName="Jesse", gender="female", grade=1 };
	Pet pet = new Pet { givenName = "Fluffy" };
	Address address = new Address { state = "NY", county = "Manhattan", city = "NY" };
	Family family = new Family { Id = "WakefieldFamily", parents = new Parent [] { mother, father}, children = new Child[] { child }, isRegistered = false };


**JSON**  

	{
	    "id": "WakefieldFamily",
	    "parents": [
	        { "familyName": "Wakefield", "givenName": "Robin" },
	        { "familyName": "Miller", "givenName": "Ben" }
	    ],
	    "children": [
	        {
	            "familyName": "Merriam", 
	            "givenName": "Jesse", 
	            "gender": "female", 
	            "grade": 1,
	            "pets": [
	                { "givenName": "Goofy" },
	                { "givenName": "Shadow" }
	            ]
	        },
	        { 
	          "familyName": "Miller", 
	          "givenName": "Lisa", 
	          "gender": "female", 
	          "grade": 8 
	        }
	    ],
	    "address": { "state": "NY", "county": "Manhattan", "city": "NY" },
	    "isRegistered": false
	};



###LINQ to SQL Translation
The DocumentDB query provider performs a best effort mapping from a LINQ query into a DocumentDB SQL query. In the following description, we assume the reader has a basic familiarity of LINQ.

First, for the type system, we support all JSON primitive types – numeric types, boolean, string, and null. Only these JSON types are supported. The following scalar expressions are supported.

-	Constant values – these includes constant values of the primitive data types at the time the query is evaluated.

-	Property/array index expressions – these expressions refer to the property of an object or an array element.

		family.Id;
		family.children[0].familyName;
		family.children[0].grade;
		family.children[n].grade; //n is an int variable

-	Arithmetic expressions - These include common arithmetic expressions on numerical and boolean values. For the complete list, refer to the SQL specification.

		2 * family.children[0].grade;
		x + y;

-	String comparison expression - these include comparing a string value to some constant string value.  
 
		mother.familyName == "Smith";
		child.givenName == s; //s is a string variable

-	Object/array creation expression - these expressions return an object of compound value type or anonymous type or an array of such objects. These values can be nested.

		new Parent { familyName = "Smith", givenName = "Joe" };
		new { first = 1, second = 2 }; //an anonymous type with 2 fields              
		new int[] { 3, child.grade, 5 };

###Query Operators
Here are some examples that illustrate how some of the standard LINQ query operators are translated down to DocumentDB queries.

####Select Operator
The syntax is `input.Select(x => f(x))`, where `f` is a scalar expression.

**LINQ Lambda Expression**

	input.Select(family => family.parents[0].familyName);

**SQL** 

	SELECT VALUE f.parents[0].familyName
	FROM Families f



**LINQ Lambda Expression**

	input.Select(family => family.children[0].grade + c); // c is an int variable


**SQL** 

	SELECT VALUE f.children[0].grade + c
	FROM Families f 



**LINQ Lambda Expression**

	input.Select(family => new
	{
	    name = family.children[0].familyName,
	    grade = family.children[0].grade + 3
	});


**SQL** 

	SELECT VALUE {"name":f.children[0].familyName, 
	              "grade": f.children[0].grade + 3 }
	FROM Families f



####SelectMany Operator
The syntax is `input.SelectMany(x => f(x))`, where `f` is a scalar expression that returns a collection type.

**LINQ Lambda Expression**

	input.SelectMany(family => family.children);

**SQL** 

	SELECT VALUE child
	FROM child IN Families.children



####Where Operator
The syntax is `input.Where(x => f(x))`, where `f` is a scalar expression which returns a Boolean value.

**LINQ Lambda Expression**

	input.Where(family=> family.parents[0].familyName == "Smith");

**SQL** 

	SELECT *
	FROM Families f
	WHERE f.parents[0].familyName = "Smith" 



**LINQ Lambda Expression**

	input.Where(
	    family => family.parents[0].familyName == "Smith" && 
	    family.children[0].grade < 3);

**SQL** 

	SELECT *
	FROM Families f
	WHERE f.parents[0].familyName = "Smith"
	AND f.children[0].grade < 3


###Composite Queries
The above operators can be composed to form more powerful queries. Since DocumentDB supports nested collections, the composition can either be concatenated or nested.

####Concatenation 

The syntax is `input(.|.SelectMany())(.Select()|.Where())*`. A concatenated query can start with an optional `SelectMany` query followed by multiple `Select` or `Where` operators.


**LINQ Lambda Expression**

	input.Select(family=>family.parents[0])
	    .Where(familyName == "Smith");

**SQL**

	SELECT *
	FROM Families f
	WHERE f.parents[0].familyName = "Smith"



**LINQ Lambda Expression**

	input.Where(family => family.children[0].grade > 3)
	    .Select(family => family.parents[0].familyName);

**SQL** 

	SELECT VALUE f.parents[0].familyName
	FROM Families f
	WHERE f.children[0].grade > 3



**LINQ Lambda Expression**

	input.Select(family => new { grade=family.children[0].grade}).
	    Where(anon=> anon.grade < 3);
            
**SQL** 

	SELECT *
	FROM Families f
	WHERE ({grade: f.children[0].grade}.grade > 3)



**LINQ Lambda Expression**

	input.SelectMany(family => family.parents)
	    .Where(parent => parents.familyName == "Smith");

**SQL** 

	SELECT *
	FROM p IN Families.parents
	WHERE p.familyName = "Smith"



####Nesting

The syntax is `input.SelectMany(x=>x.Q())` where Q is a `Select`, `SelectMany`, or `Where` operator.

In a nested query, the inner query is applied to each element of the outer collection. One important feature is that the inner query can refer to the fields of the elements in the outer collection like self-joins.

**LINQ Lambda Expression**

	input.SelectMany(family=> 
	    family.parents.Select(p => p.familyName));

**SQL** 

	SELECT VALUE p.familyName
	FROM Families f
	JOIN p IN f.parents


**LINQ Lambda Expression**

	input.SelectMany(family => 
	    family.children.Where(child => child.familyName == "Jeff"));
            
**SQL** 

	SELECT *
	FROM Families f
	JOIN c IN f.children
	WHERE c.familyName = "Jeff"



**LINQ Lambda Expression**
            
	input.SelectMany(family => family.children.Where(
	    child => child.familyName == family.parents[0].familyName));

**SQL** 

	SELECT *
	FROM Families f
	JOIN c IN f.children
	WHERE c.familyName = f.parents[0].familyName


##Executing Queries
DocumentDB exposes resources through a REST API that can be called by any language capable of making HTTP/HTTPS requests. Additionally, DocumentDB offers programming libraries for several popular languages like .NET, Node.js, JavaScript and Python. The REST API and the various libraries all support querying through SQL. The .NET SDK supports LINQ querying in addition to SQL.

The following examples show how to create a query and submit it against a DocumentDB database account.
###REST API
DocumentDB offers an open RESTful programming model over HTTP. Database accounts can be provisioned using an Azure subscription. The DocumentDB resource model consists of a sets of resources under a database account, each  of which is addressable using a logical and stable URI. A set of resources is referred to as a feed in this document. A database account consists of a set of databases, each containing multiple collections, each of which in-turn contain documents, UDFs, and other resource types.

The basic interaction model with these resources is through the HTTP verbs GET, PUT, POST and DELETE with their standard interpretation. The POST verb is used for creation of a new resource, for executing a stored procedure or for issuing a DocumentDB query. Queries are always read only operations with no side-effects.

The following examples show a POST for a DocumentDB query made against a collection containing the two sample documents we've reviewed so far. The query has a simple filter on the JSON name property. Note the use of the `x-ms-documentdb-isquery` and Content-Type: `application/query+json` headers to denote that the operation is a query.


**Request**

	POST https://<REST URI>/docs HTTP/1.1
	...
	x-ms-documentdb-isquery: True
	Content-Type: application/query+json

    {      
        "query": "SELECT * FROM Families f WHERE f.id = @familyId",     
        "parameters": [          
            {"name": "@familyId", "value": "AndersenFamily"}         
        ] 
    }
	

**Results**

	HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
	x-ms-activity-id: 8b4678fa-a947-47d3-8dd3-549a40da6eed
	x-ms-item-count: 1
	x-ms-request-charge: 0.32
	
	<indented for readability, results highlighted>
	
	{  
	   "_rid":"u1NXANcKogE=",
	   "Documents":[  
	      {  
	         "id":"AndersenFamily",
	         "lastName":"Andersen",
	         "parents":[  
	            {  
	               "firstName":"Thomas"
	            },
	            {  
	               "firstName":"Mary Kay"
	            }
	         ],
	         "children":[  
	            {  
	               "firstName":"Henriette Thaulow",
	               "gender":"female",
	               "grade":5,
	               "pets":[  
	                  {  
	                     "givenName":"Fluffy"
	                  }
	               ]
	            }
	         ],
	         "address":{  
	            "state":"WA",
	            "county":"King",
	            "city":"seattle"
	         },
	         "_rid":"u1NXANcKogEcAAAAAAAAAA==",
	         "_ts":1407691744,
	         "_self":"dbs\/u1NXAA==\/colls\/u1NXANcKogE=\/docs\/u1NXANcKogEcAAAAAAAAAA==\/",
	         "_etag":"00002b00-0000-0000-0000-53e7abe00000",
	         "_attachments":"_attachments\/"
	      }
	   ],
	   "count":1
	}


The second example shows a more complex query that returns multiple results from the join.

**Request**

	POST https://<REST URI>/docs HTTP/1.1
	...
	x-ms-documentdb-isquery: True
	Content-Type: application/query+json
	
    {      
        "query": "SELECT 
				     f.id AS familyName, 
				     c.givenName AS childGivenName, 
				     c.firstName AS childFirstName, 
				     p.givenName AS petName 
				  FROM Families f 
				  JOIN c IN f.children 
				  JOIN p in c.pets",     
        "parameters": [] 
    }


**Results**

	HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
	x-ms-activity-id: 568f34e3-5695-44d3-9b7d-62f8b83e509d
	x-ms-item-count: 1
	x-ms-request-charge: 7.84
	
	<indented for readability, results highlighted>
	
	{  
	   "_rid":"u1NXANcKogE=",
	   "Documents":[  
	      {  
	         "familyName":"AndersenFamily",
	         "childFirstName":"Henriette Thaulow",
	         "petName":"Fluffy"
	      },
	      {  
	         "familyName":"WakefieldFamily",
	         "childGivenName":"Jesse",
	         "petName":"Goofy"
	      },
	      {  
	         "familyName":"WakefieldFamily",
	         "childGivenName":"Jesse",
	         "petName":"Shadow"
	      }
	   ],
	   "count":3
	}


If a query's results cannot fit within a single page of results, then the REST API returns a continuation token through the `x-ms-continuation-token` response header. Clients can paginate results by including the header in subsequent results. The number of results per page can also be controlled through the `x-ms-max-item-count` number header.

To manage the data consistency policy for queries, use the `x-ms-consistency-level` header like all REST API requests. For session consistency, it is required to also echo the latest `x-ms-session-token` Cookie header in the query request. Note that the queried collection's indexing policy can also influence the consistency of query results. With the default indexing policy settings, for collections the index is always current with the document contents and query results will match the consistency chosen for data. If the indexing policy is relaxed to Lazy, then queries can return stale results. For more information, refer to [DocumentDB Consistency Levels] [consistency-levels].

If the configured indexing policy on the collection cannot support the specified query, the DocumentDB server returns 400 "Bad Request". This is returned for range queries against paths configured for hash (equality) lookups, and for paths explicitly excluded from indexing. The `x-ms-documentdb-query-enable-scan` header can be specified to allow the query to perform a scan when an index is not available.

###C# (.NET) SDK
The .NET SDK supports both LINQ and SQL querying. The following example shows how to perform the simple filter query introduced earlier in this document.


	foreach (var family in client.CreateDocumentQuery(collectionLink, 
	    "SELECT * FROM Families f WHERE f.id = \"AndersenFamily\""))
	{
	    Console.WriteLine("\tRead {0} from SQL", family);
	}
	
    SqlQuerySpec query = new SqlQuerySpec("SELECT * FROM Families f WHERE f.id = @familyId");
    query.Parameters = new SqlParameterCollection();
    query.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@familyId", "AndersenFamily"));

    foreach (var family in client.CreateDocumentQuery(collectionLink, query))
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\tRead {0} from parameterized SQL", family);
    }

	foreach (var family in (
	    from f in client.CreateDocumentQuery(collectionLink)
	    where f.Id == "AndersenFamily"
	    select f))
	{
	    Console.WriteLine("\tRead {0} from LINQ query", family);
	}
	
	foreach (var family in client.CreateDocumentQuery(collectionLink)
	    .Where(f => f.Id == "AndersenFamily")
	    .Select(f => f))
	{
	    Console.WriteLine("\tRead {0} from LINQ lambda", family);
	}


This sample compares two properties for equality within each document and uses anonymous projections. 


	foreach (var family in client.CreateDocumentQuery(collectionLink,
	    @"SELECT {""Name"": f.id, ""City"":f.address.city} AS Family 
	    FROM Families f 
	    WHERE f.address.city = f.address.state"))
	{
	    Console.WriteLine("\tRead {0} from SQL", family);
	}
	
	foreach (var family in (
	    from f in client.CreateDocumentQuery<Family>(collectionLink)
	    where f.address.city == f.address.state
	    select new { Name = f.Id, City = f.address.city }))
	{
	    Console.WriteLine("\tRead {0} from LINQ query", family);
	}
	
	foreach (var family in
	    client.CreateDocumentQuery<Family>(collectionLink)
	    .Where(f => f.address.city == f.address.state)
	    .Select(f => new { Name = f.Id, City = f.address.city }))
	{
	    Console.WriteLine("\tRead {0} from LINQ lambda", family);
	}


The next sample shows joins, expressed through LINQ SelectMany.


	foreach (var pet in client.CreateDocumentQuery(collectionLink,
	      @"SELECT p
	        FROM Families f 
	             JOIN c IN f.children 
	             JOIN p in c.pets 
	        WHERE p.givenName = ""Shadow"""))
	{
	    Console.WriteLine("\tRead {0} from SQL", pet);
	}
	
	// Equivalent in Lambda expressions
	foreach (var pet in
	    client.CreateDocumentQuery<Family>(collectionLink)
	    .SelectMany(f => f.children)
	    .SelectMany(c => c.pets)
	    .Where(p => p.givenName == "Shadow"))
	{
	    Console.WriteLine("\tRead {0} from LINQ lambda", pet);
	}



The .NET client automatically iterates through all the pages of query results in the foreach blocks as shown above. The query options introduced in the REST API section are also available in the .NET SDK using the `FeedOptions` and `FeedResponse` classes in the CreateDocumentQuery method. The number of pages can be controlled using the `MaxItemCount` setting. 

Developers can also explicitly control paging by creating `IDocumentQueryable` using the `IQueryable` object, then by reading the` ResponseContinuationToken` values and passing them back as `RequestContinuationToken` in `FeedOptions`. `EnableScanInQuery` can be set to enable scans when the query cannot be supported by the configured indexing policy.

Refer to [DocumentDB .NET samples](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Azure-DocumentDB-NET-Code-6b3da8af#content) for more samples containing queries. 

###JavaScript Server-side API 
DocumentDB provides a programming model for executing JavaScript based application logic directly on the collections using stored procedures and triggers. The JavaScript logic registered at a collection level can then issue database operations on the operations on the documents of the given collection. These operations are wrapped in ambient ACID transactions.

The following example show how to use the queryDocuments in the JavaScript server API to make queries from inside stored procedures and triggers.


	function businessLogic(name, author) {
	    var context = getContext();
	    var collectionManager = context.getCollection();
	    var collectionLink = collectionManager.getSelfLink()
	
	    // create a new document.
	    collectionManager.createDocument(collectionLink,
	        { name: name, author: author },
	        function (err, documentCreated) {
