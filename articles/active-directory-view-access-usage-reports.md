# View your access and usage reports

You can use Azure Active Directory's access and usage reports to gain visibility into the integrity and security of your organization’s directory. With this information, a directory admin can better determine where possible security risks may lie so that they can adequately plan to mitigate those risks.

In the Azure Management Portal, reports are categorized in the following ways:

- Anomaly reports – Contain sign in events that we found to be anomalous. Our goal is to make you aware of such activity and enable you to be able to make a determination about whether an event is suspicious. 
- Integrated Application reports – Provides insights into how cloud applications are being used in your organization. Azure Active Directory offers integration with thousands of cloud applications. 
- Error reports – Indicate errors that may occur when provisioning accounts to external applications.
- User-specific reports – Display device/sign in activity data for a specific user.
- Activity logs – Contain a record of all audited events within the last 24 hours, last 7 days, or last 30 days, as well as group activity changes, and password reset and registration activity.

> [AZURE.NOTE]
> 
- Some advanced anomaly and resource usage reports are only available when you enable [Azure Active Directory Premium](active-directory-get-started-premium.md). Advanced reports help you improve access security, respond to potential threats and get access to analytics on device access and application usage.
- Azure Active Directory Premium and Basic editions are available for customers in China using the worldwide instance of Azure Active Directory. Azure Active Directory Premium and Basic editions are not currently supported in the Microsoft Azure service operated by 21Vianet in China. For more information, contact us at the [Azure Active Directory Forum](http://feedback.azure.com/forums/169401-azure-active-directory).

<td><p>This report indicates users who have successfully signed in to your directory while assigned a client IP address that has been recognized by Microsoft as an anonymous proxy IP address. These proxies are often used by users that want to hide their computer’s IP address, and may be used for malicious intent – sometimes hackers use these proxies.</p><p>Results from this report will show the number of times a user successfully signed in to your directory from that address and the proxy’s IP address.</p></td>

The machine learning algorithm classifies events as “anomalous” or “suspicious”, where “suspicious” indicates a higher likelihood of a security breach.</p><p>Results from this report will show you these sign ins, together with the classification, location and a timestamp associated with each sign in.</p><p>We will send an email notification to the global admins if we encounter 10 or more anomalous sign in events within a span of 30 days or less.

## Things to consider if you suspect security breach

If you suspect that a user account may be compromised or any kind of suspicious user activity that may lead to a security breach of your directory data in the cloud, you may want to consider one or more of the following actions:

- Contact the user to verify the activity
- Reset the user's password
- [Enable multi-factor authentication](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=335774) for additional security

## View or download a report

1. In the Azure Management Portal, click **Active Directory**, click the name of your organization’s directory, and then click **Reports**.
2. On the Reports page, click the report you want to view and/or download.
    > [AZURE.NOTE] If this is the first time you have used the reporting feature of Azure Active Directory, you will see a message to Opt In. If you agree, click the check mark icon to continue.
3. Click the drop-down menu next to Interval, and then select one of the following time ranges that should be used when generating this report:
    - Last 24 hours
    - Last 7 days
    - Last 30 days
4. Click the check mark icon to run the report.
5. If applicable, click **Download** to download the report to a compressed file in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format for offline viewing or archiving purposes.

## Ignore an event

If you are viewing any anomaly reports, you may notice that you can ignore various events that show up in related reports. To ignore an event, simply highlight the event in the report and then click **Ignore**. The **Ignore** button will permanently remove the highlighted event from the report and can only be used by licensed global admins.

## Automatic email notifications 

### What reports generate email notifications

At this time, only the Anomalous Sign In Activity report and the Users with Anomalous Sign In Activity report are using the email notification system.

### What triggers the email notification to be sent?

By default, Azure Active Directory is set to automatically send email notifications to all global admins. The email is sent under the following conditions for each report.

For the Anomalous Sign In Activity report:

- Unknown sources: 10 events
- Multiple failures: 10 events
- IP addresses with suspicious activity: 10 events
- Infected devices: 10 events

For the Users with Anomalous Sign In Activity report:

- Unknown sources: 10 events
- Multiple failures: 10 events
- IP addresses with suspicious activity: 10 events
- Infected devices: 5 events
- Anomalous sign ins report: 15 events

The email is sent if any of the above conditions is met within 30 days, or since the last email was sent if it is less than 30 days.

Anomalous Sign Ins are those that have been identified as “anomalous” by our machine learning algorithms, on the basis of unexpected sign in locations, time of day and locations or a combination of these. This may indicate that a hacker has been trying to sign in using this account. More information about this report can be found in the table above.

### Who receives the email notifications?

The email is sent to all global admins who have been assigned an Active Directory Premium license. To ensure it is delivered, we send it to the admins Alternate Email Address as well. Admins should include aad-alerts-noreply@mail.windowsazure.com in their safe senders list so they don’t miss the email.

### How often are these emails sent?

Once an email is sent, the next one will be sent only when 10 or more new Anomalous Sign In events are encountered within 30 days of sending that email. How do I access the report mentioned in the email? 

When you click on the link, you will be redirected to the report page within the Azure Management Portal. In order to access the report, you need to be both:

- An admin or co-admin of your Azure subscription
- A global administrator in the directory, and assigned an Active Directory Premium license. For more information, see Azure Active Directory editions. 

### Can I turn off these emails?

Yes, to turn off notifications related to anomalous sign ins within the Azure Management Portal, click **Configure**, and then select **Disabled** under the **Notifications** section.
