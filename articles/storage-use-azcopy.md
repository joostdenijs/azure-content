# Getting Started with the AzCopy Command-Line Utility

## Overview

AzCopy is a command-line utility designed for high-performance uploading, downloading, and copying data to and from Microsoft Azure Blob, File, and Table storage. This guide provides an overview for using AzCopy.

> [AZURE.NOTE] This guide assumes that you have installed AzCopy 3.1.0 or later. AzCopy 3.x is now in general availability.
> 
> This guide also covers using AzCopy 4.1.0, which is a preview release of AzCopy. Throughout this guide, functions provided only in the preview release are designated as *preview*.
> 
> Note that for AzCopy 4.x, command-line options and functionality may change in future releases.

## Download and install AzCopy

1. Download the [latest version of AzCopy](http://aka.ms/downloadazcopy), or the [latest preview version](http://aka.ms/downloadazcopypr).
2. Run the installation. By default, the AzCopy installation creates a folder named `AzCopy` under `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\` (on a machine running 64-bit Windows) or `%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\` (on a machine running 32-bit Windows). However, you can change the installation path from the setup wizard.
3. If desired, you can add the AzCopy installation location to your system path.

## Understand the AzCopy command-line syntax

Next, open a command window, and navigate to the AzCopy installation directory on your computer, where the `AzCopy.exe` executable is located. The basic syntax for AzCopy commands is:

	AzCopy /Source:<source> /Dest:<destination> /Pattern:<filepattern> [Options]

> [AZURE.NOTE] Beginning with AzCopy version 3.0.0, the AzCopy command-line syntax requires that every parameter be specified to include the parameter name, *e.g.*, `/ParameterName:ParameterValue`.

Parameters for AzCopy are described in the table below. You can also type one of the following commands from the command line for help in using AzCopy:

- For detailed command-line help for AzCopy: `AzCopy /?`
- For detailed help with any AzCopy parameter: `AzCopy /?:SourceKey`
- For command-line examples: `AzCopy /?:Samples`

  <tr>
    <td><b>/Pattern:&lt;file-pattern&gt;</b></td>
      <td>
          Specifies a file pattern that indicates which files to copy. The behavior of the /Pattern parameter is determined by the location of the source data, and the presence of the recursive mode option. Recursive mode is specified via option /S.
          <br />
          If the specified source is a directory in the file system, then standard wildcards are in effect, and the file pattern provided is matched against files within the directory. If option /S is specified, then AzCopy also matches the specified pattern against all files in any subfolders beneath the directory.
          <br />
          If the specified source is a blob container or virtual directory, then wildcards are not applied. If option&nbsp;/S&nbsp;is specified, then AzCopy interprets the specified file pattern as a blob prefix. If option&nbsp;/S&nbsp;is not specified, then AzCopy matches the file pattern against exact blob names.
          <br />
          If the specified source is an Azure file share, then you must either specify the exact file name, (e.g.&nbsp;abc.txt) to copy a single file, or specify option&nbsp;/S&nbsp;to copy all files in the share recursively. Attempting to specify both a file pattern and option /S&nbsp;together will result in an error.
          <br />
          The default file pattern used when no file pattern is specified is *.* for a file system location or an empty prefix for an Azure Storage location. Specifying multiple file patterns is not supported.</td>

        If this option is not specified, or it is specified without a folder path, then AzCopy will create the journal file in the default location, which is <code>%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Azure\AzCopy</code>.<br />
        Each time you issue a command to AzCopy, it checks whether a journal file exists in the default folder, or whether it exists in a folder that you specified via this option. If the journal file does not exist in either place, AzCopy treats the operation as new and generates a new journal file.
        <br />
		If the journal file does exist, AzCopy will check whether the command line that you input matches the command line in the journal file. If the two command lines match, AzCopy resumes the incomplete operation. If they do not match, you will be prompted to either overwrite the journal file to start a new operation, or to cancel the current operation. 
        <br />
        The journal file is deleted upon successful completion of the operation.

## Limit concurrent writes while copying data

When you copy blobs or files with AzCopy, keep in mind that another application may be modifying the data while you are copying it. If possible, ensure that the data you are copying is not being modified during the copy operation. For example, when copying a VHD associated with an Azure virtual machine, make sure that no other applications are currently writing to the VHD. Alternately, you can create a snapshot of the VHD first and then copy the snapshot.

If you cannot prevent other applications from writing to blobs or files while they are being copied, then keep in mind that by the time the job finishes, the copied resources may no longer have full parity with the source resources.

## Copy Azure blobs with AzCopy

The examples below demonstrate a variety of scenarios for copying blobs with AzCopy.

### Copy a single blob

**Upload a file from the file system to Blob storage:**
	
	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /DestKey:key /Pattern:abc.txt

**Download a blob from Blob storage to the file system:**

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /Pattern:abc.txt

For more information about working with your storage access keys, please see [View, copy, and regenerate storage access keys](../storage-create-storage-account/#regeneratestoragekeys).

### Copy a blob via server-side copy

When you copy a blob within a storage account or across storage accounts, a server-side copy operation is performed. For more information about server-side copy operations, see [Introducing Asynchronous Cross-Account Copy Blob](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2012/06/12/introducing-asynchronous-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx).

**Copy a blob within a storage account:**

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2 /SourceKey:key /DestKey:key /Pattern:abc.txt 

**Copy a blob across storage accounts:**

	AzCopy /Source:https://sourceaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 /Dest:https://destaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2 /SourceKey:key1 /DestKey:key2 /Pattern:abc.txt
 
### Copy a blob from the secondary region 

If your storage account has read-access geo-redundant storage enabled, then you can copy data from the secondary region. 

**Copy a blob to the primary account from the secondary:**

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount1-secondary.blob.core.windows.net/mynewcontainer1 /Dest:https://myaccount2.blob.core.windows.net/mynewcontainer2 /SourceKey:key1 /DestKey:key2 /Pattern:abc.txt

**Download a blob in the secondary to a file in the file system:**

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount-secondary.blob.core.windows.net/mynewcontainer /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /Pattern:abc.txt

### Upload a file to a new blob container or virtual directory

**Upload a file to a new blob container**

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mynewcontainer /DestKey:key /Pattern:abc.txt

Note that if the specified destination container does not exist, AzCopy will create it and upload the file into it.

**Upload a file to a new blob virtual directory**

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/vd /DestKey:key /Pattern:abc.txt

Note that if the specified virtual directory does not exist, AzCopy will upload the file to include the virtual directory in its name (*e.g.*, `vd/abc.txt` in the example above).

### Download a blob to a new folder

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /Pattern:abc.txt

If the folder `C:\myfolder` does not yet exist, AzCopy will create it in the file system and download `abc.txt ` into the new folder.

### Upload files and subfolders in a directory to a container, recursively

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /DestKey:key /S

Specifying option `/S` copies the contents of the specified directory to Blob storage recursively, meaning that all subfolders and their files will be copied as well. For instance, assume the following files reside in folder `C:\myfolder`:

	C:\myfolder\abc.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc1.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc2.txt
	C:\myfolder\subfolder\a.txt
	C:\myfolder\subfolder\abcd.txt

After the copy operation, the container will include the following files:

    abc.txt
    abc1.txt
    abc2.txt
    subfolder\a.txt
    subfolder\abcd.txt

### Upload files from a directory to a container, non-recursively

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /DestKey:key

If you do not specify option `/S` on the command line, AzCopy will not copy recursively. Only the files in the specified directory are copied; any subfolders and their files are NOT copied. For instance, assume the following files reside in folder `C:\myfolder`:

	C:\myfolder\abc.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc1.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc2.txt
	C:\myfolder\subfolder\a.txt
	C:\myfolder\subfolder\abcd.txt

After the copy operation, the container will include the following files:

	abc.txt
	abc1.txt
	abc2.txt

### Download all blobs in a container to a directory in the file system, recursively

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /S

Assume the following blobs reside in the specified container:  

	abc.txt
	abc1.txt
	abc2.txt
	vd1\a.txt
	vd1\abcd.txt

After the copy operation, the directory `C:\myfolder` will include the following files:

	C:\myfolder\abc.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc1.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc2.txt
	C:\myfolder\vd1\a.txt
	C:\myfolder\vd1\abcd.txt

### Download blobs in a virtual blob directory to a directory in the file system, recursively

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/vd1/ /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /S

Assume the following blobs reside in the specified container:

	abc.txt
	abc1.txt
	abc2.txt
	vd1\a.txt
	vd1\abcd.txt

After the copy operation, the directory `C:\myfolder` will include the following files. Note that only the blobs in the virtual directory are copied:

	C:\myfolder\a.txt
	C:\myfolder\abcd.txt

### Upload files matching the specified file pattern to a container, recursively 

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /DestKey:key /Pattern:a* /S

Assume the following files reside in folder `C:\myfolder`:

	C:\myfolder\abc.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc1.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc2.txt
	C:\myfolder\xyz.txt
	C:\myfolder\subfolder\a.txt
	C:\myfolder\subfolder\abcd.txt

After the copy operation, the container will include the following files:

	abc.txt
	abc1.txt
	abc2.txt
	subfolder\a.txt
	subfolder\abcd.txt
	
### Download blobs with the specified prefix to the file system, recursively

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /Pattern:a /S

Assume the following blobs reside in the specified container. All blobs beginning with the prefix `a` will be copied:

	abc.txt
	abc1.txt
	abc2.txt
	xyz.txt
	vd1\a.txt
	vd1\abcd.txt

After the copy operation, the folder `C:\myfolder` will include the following files:

	C:\myfolder\abc.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc1.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc2.txt

Note that the prefix applies to the virtual directory, which forms the first part of the blob name. In the example shown above, the virtual directory does not match the specified prefix, so it is not copied.


### Copy a blob and its snapshots to another storage account

	AzCopy /Source:https://sourceaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 /Dest:https://destaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2 /SourceKey:key1 /DestKey:key2 /Pattern:abc.txt /Snapshot

After the copy operation, the target container will include the blob and its snapshots. Assuming the blob in the example above has two snapshots, the container will include the following blob and snapshots:

	abc.txt
	abc (2013-02-25 080757).txt
	abc (2014-02-21 150331).txt


### Use a response file to specify command-line parameters

	AzCopy /@:"C:\myfolder\abc.txt"

You can include any AzCopy command-line parameters in a response file. AzCopy processes the parameters in the file as if they had been specified on the command line, performing a direct substitution with the contents of the file.

**Specify one or more single-line response files**

Assume a response file named `source.txt` that specifies a source container:

	/Source:http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer

And a response file named `dest.txt` that specifies a destination folder in the file system:

	/Dest:C:\myfolder

And a response file named `options.txt` that specifies options for AzCopy:

	/S /Y

To call AzCopy with these response files, all of which reside in a directory `C:\responsefiles`, use this command:

	AzCopy /@:"C:\responsefiles\source.txt" /@:"C:\responsefiles\dest.txt" /SourceKey:<sourcekey> /@:"C:\responsefiles\options.txt"   

AzCopy processes this command just as it would if you included all of the individual parameters on the command line:

	AzCopy /Source:http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:<sourcekey> /S /Y

**Specify a multi-line response file**

Assume a response file named `copyoperation.txt`, that contains the following lines. Each AzCopy parameter is specified on its own line:

	/Source:http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer
	/Dest:C:\myfolder
	/SourceKey:<sourcekey>
	/S 
	/Y

To call AzCopy with this response files, use this command:

	AzCopy /@:"C:\responsefiles\copyoperation.txt"

AzCopy processes this command just as it would if you included all of the individual parameters on the command line:	

	AzCopy /Source:http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:<sourcekey> /S /Y

Note that each AzCopy parameter must be specified all on one line. For example, AzCopy will fail if you split the parameter across two lines, as shown here for the `/sourcekey` parameter:

	http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer
 	C:\myfolder
	/sourcekey:
	[sourcekey]
	/S 
	/Y

### Specify a shared access signature (SAS)
	
**Specify a SAS for the source container using the /sourceSAS option**

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 /DestC:\myfolder /SourceSAS:SAS /S

**Specify a SAS for the source container on the source container URI**

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1/?SourceSASToken /Dest:C:\myfolder /S

**Specify a SAS for the destination container using the /destSAS option**

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 /DestSAS:SAS /Pattern:abc.txt

**Specify a SAS for the source and destination containers**

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2 /SourceSAS:SAS1 /DestSAS:SAS2 /Pattern:abc.txt

### Specify a journal file folder

Each time you issue a command to AzCopy, it checks whether a journal file exists in the default folder, or whether it exists in a folder that you specified via this option. If the journal file does not exist in either place, AzCopy treats the operation as new and generates a new journal file.

If the journal file does exist, AzCopy will check whether the command line that you input matches the command line in the journal file. If the two command lines match, AzCopy resumes the incomplete operation. If they do not match, you will be prompted to either overwrite the journal file to start a new operation, or to cancel the current operation. 

**Use the default location for the journal file**

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /DestKey:key /Z

If you omit option `/Z`, or specify option `/Z` without the folder path, as shown above, AzCopy creates the journal file in the default location, which is `%SystemDrive%\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Azure\AzCopy`. If the journal file already exists, then AzCopy resumes the operation based on the journal file. 

**Specify a custom location for the journal file**

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /DestKey:key /Z:C:\journalfolder\

This example creates the journal file if it does not already exist. If it does exist, then AzCopy resumes the operation based on the journal file.

**Resume an AzCopy operation**

	AzCopy /Z:C:\journalfolder\

This example resumes the last operation, which may have failed to complete.


### Generate a log file

**Write to the verbose log file in the default location**

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /DestKey:key /V

If you specify option `/V` without providing a file path to the verbose log, then AzCopy creates the log file in the default location, which is `%SystemDrive%\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Azure\AzCopy`.

**Write to the verbose log file in a custom location**

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /DestKey:key /V:C:\myfolder\azcopy1.log

Note that if you specify a relative path following option `/V`, such as `/V:test/azcopy1.log`, then the verbose log is created in the current working directory within a subfolder named `test`.


### Set the last-modified time of downloaded files to be same as the source blobs

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /MT

### Exclude blobs from the copy operation based on their last-modified time

Specify the `/MT` option to compare the last-modified time of the source blob and the destination file.

**Exclude blobs that are newer than the destination file**

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /MT /XN

**Exclude blobs that are older than the destination file**

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /MT /XO

### Specify the number of concurrent operations to start

Option `/NC` specifies the number of concurrent copy operations. By default, AzCopy will begin concurrent operations at eight times the number of core processors you have. If you are running AzCopy across a low-bandwidth network, you can specify a lower number for this option to avoid failure caused by resource competition.


### 	Run AzCopy against blob resources in the storage emulator

	AzCopy /Source:https://127.0.0.1:10004/myaccount/myfileshare/ /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /SourceType:Blob /S

### Synchronously copy blobs between two Azure Storage endpoints

AzCopy by default copies data between two storage endpoints asynchronously. Therefore, the copy operation will run in the background using spare bandwidth capacity that has no SLA in terms of how fast a blob will be copied, and AzCopy will periodically check the copy status until the copying is completed or failed. 

The `/SyncCopy` option, new in the 3.1.0 release, ensures that the copy operation will get consistent speed. AzCopy performs the synchronous copy by downloading the blobs to copy from the specified source to local memory, and then uploading them to the Blob storage destination.

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount1.blob.core.windows.net/myContainer/ /Dest:https://myaccount2.blob.core.windows.net/myContainer/ /SourceKey:key1 /DestKey:key2 /Pattern:ab /SyncCopy

Note that /SyncCopy might generate additional egress cost comparing to asynchronous copy, the recommended approach is to use this option in the Azure VM which is in the same region as your source storage account to avoid egress cost.

### Specify the MIME content type of a destination blob

By default, AzCopy sets the content type of a destination blob to `application/octet-stream`. Beginning with version 3.1.0, you can explicitly specify the content type via the option `/SetContentType:[content-type]`. This syntax sets the content type for all blobs in a copy operation.

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder\ /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myContainer/ /DestKey:key /Pattern:ab /SetContentType:video/mp4

If you specify `/SetContentType` without a value, then AzCopy will set each blob or file's content type according to its file extension.

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder\ /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myContainer/ /DestKey:key /Pattern:ab /SetContentType

## Copy files in Azure File storage with AzCopy (preview version only)

The examples below demonstrate a variety of scenarios for copying Azure files with AzCopy.

### Download a file from an Azure file share to the file system

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/myfolder1/ /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /Pattern:abc.txt

Note that if the specified source is an Azure file share, then you must either specify the exact file name, (*e.g.* `abc.txt`) to copy a single file, or specify option `/S` to copy all files in the share recursively. Attempting to specify both a file pattern and option `/S` together will result in an error.

### Download files and folders in an Azure file share to the file system, recursively

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /S

Note that any empty folders will not be copied.


### Upload files and folders from the file system to an Azure file share, recursively

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder /Dest:https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ /DestKey:key /S

Note that any empty folders will not be copied.


### Upload files matching the specified file pattern to an Azure file share, recursively

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder /Dest:https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ /DestKey:key /Pattern:ab* /S


### Synchronously copy files in Azure File Storage

With the new option /SyncCopy in 4.1.0-Preview version, user can copy files from File Storage to File Storage, from File Storage to Blob Storage and from Blob Storage to File Storage.

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount1.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare1/ /Dest:https://myaccount2.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare2/ /SourceKey:key1 /DestKey:key2 /S /SyncCopy

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount1.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ /Dest:https://myaccount2.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/ /SourceKey:key1 /DestKey:key2 /S /SyncCopy
	
	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount1.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/ /Dest:https://myaccount2.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ /SourceKey:key1 /DestKey:key2 /S /SyncCopy

When copying from File Storage to Blob Storage, the default blob type is block blob, user can specify option /BlobType:page to change the destination blob type.

Note that Azure Storage Service does not support asynchronous copy yet when AzCopy 4.1.0-preview released, therefore, the above copy operations will be failed if the option /SyncCopy is not specified.


## Copy Entities in an Azure Table with AzCopy (preview version only)

The examples below demonstrate a variety of scenarios for copying Azure Table Entities with AzCopy.

### Export entities to the local file system

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.table.core.windows.net/myTable/ /Dest:C:\myfolder\ /SourceKey:key

### Export entities to an Azure blob

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.table.core.windows.net/myTable/ /Dest:https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/ /SourceKey:key1 /Destkey:key2

AzCopy will generate a JSON data file into the local folder or blob container with following naming convention:

	<account name>_<table name>_<timestamp>_<volume index>_<CRC>.json

The generated JSON data file follows the payload format for minimal metadata. For details on this payload format, see [Payload Format for Table Service Operations](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn535600.aspx).

Note that when exporting Storage Table Entities to Storage Blob, AzCopy will export the Table entities to local temporary data files firstly and then upload them to Blob, these temporary data files are put into the journal file folder with the default path “<code>%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Azure\AzCopy</code>”, you can specify option /Z:[journal-file-folder] to change the journal file folder location and thus change the temporary data files location. The temporary data files’ size is decided by your table entities’ size and the size you specified with the option /SplitSize, although the temporary data file in local disk will be deleted instantly once it has been uploaded to the Blob, please make sure you have enough local disk space to store these temporary data files before they are deleted, 

### Split the export files

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.table.core.windows.net/mytable/ /Dest:C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /S /SplitSize:100

AzCopy uses a *volume index* in the split data file names to distinguish multiple files. The volume index consists of two parts, a *partition key range index* and a *split file index*. Both indexes are zero-based.

The partition key range index will be 0 if user does not specify option `/PKRS` (introduced in next section).

For instance, suppose AzCopy generates two data files after the user specifies option `/SplitSize`. The resulting data file names might be:

	myaccount_mytable_20140903T051850.8128447Z_0_0_C3040FE8.json
	myaccount_mytable_20140903T051850.8128447Z_0_1_0AB9AC20.json

Note that the minimum possible value for option `/SplitSize` is 32MB. If the specified destination is Blob storage, AzCopy will split the data file once its sizes reaches the blob size limitation (200GB), regardless of whether option `/SplitSize` has been specified by the user.

### Export entities concurrently

	AzCopy /Source:https://myaccount.table.core.windows.net/myTable/ /Dest:C:\myfolder\ /SourceKey:key /PKRS:"aa#bb"

AzCopy will start concurrent operations to export entities when the user specifies option `/PKRS`. Each operation exports one partition key range.

Note that the number of concurrent operations is also controlled by option `/NC`. AzCopy uses the number of core processors as the default value of `/NC` when copying table entities,  even if `/NC` was not specified. When the user specifies option `/PKRS`, AzCopy uses the smaller of the two values - partition key ranges versus implicitly or explicitly specified concurrent operations - to determine the number of concurrent operations to start. For more details, type `AzCopy /?:NC` at the command line.

### Import entities concurrently

	AzCopy /Source:C:\myfolder\ /Dest:https://myaccount.table.core.windows.net/mytable1/ /DestKey:key /Manifest:"myaccount_mytable_20140103T112020.manifest" /EntityOperation:InsertOrReplace 

When you export table entities, AzCopy writes a manifest file to the specified destination folder or blob container. The manifest file is used by the import process to locate the necessary data files and perform data validation during the import process. The manifest file uses the following naming convention:

	<account name>_<table name>_<timestamp>.manifest

The option `/EntityOperation` indicates how to insert entities into the table. Possible values are:

- `InsertOrSkip`: Skips an existing entity or inserts a new entity if it does not exist in the table.
- `InsertOrMerge`: Merges an existing entity or inserts a new entity if it does not exist in the table.
- `InsertOrReplace`: Replaces an existing entity or inserts a new entity if it does not exist in the table.

Note that you cannot specify option `/PKRS` in the import scenario. Unlike the export scenario, in which you must specify option `/PKRS` to start concurrent operations, AzCopy will by default start concurrent operations when you import entities. The default number of concurrent operations started is equal to the number of core processors; however, you can specify a different number of concurrent with option `/NC`. For more details, type `AzCopy /?:NC` at the command line.


## Known Issues and Best Practices

#### Run one AzCopy instance on one machine.
AzCopy is designed to maximize the utilization of your machine resource to accelerate the data transfer, we recommend you run only one AzCopy instance on one machine, and specify the option `/NC` if you need more concurrent operations. For more details, type `AzCopy /?:NC` at the command line.

#### Make sure "Use FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing and signing" is disabled when using AzCopy, note that this option is disabled by default.
You can type `secpol.msc` in your `Run` window and check this switch at `Security Setting->Local Policy->Security Options->System cryptography: Use FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing and signing`. Please note that this setting path might be different on the Windows operation system you are using.
