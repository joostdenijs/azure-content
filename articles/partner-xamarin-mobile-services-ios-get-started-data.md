# Add Mobile Services to an existing app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-get-started-data](../includes/mobile-services-selector-get-started-data.md)]

This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Services to leverage data in a Xamarin.iOS app. In this tutorial, you will download an app that stores data in memory, create a new mobile service, integrate the mobile service with the app, and then login to the Azure Management Portal to view changes to data made when running the app.

> [AZURE.NOTE] This tutorial is intended to help you better understand how Mobile Services enables you to use Azure to store and retrieve data from a Xamarin.iOS app. As such, this topic walks you through many of the steps that are completed for you in the Mobile Services quickstart. If this is your first experience with Mobile Services, consider first completing the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services](/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-xamarin-ios).

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps:

1. [Download the Xamarin.iOS app project][GitHub]
2. [Create the mobile service]
3. [Add a data table for storage]
4. [Update the app to use Mobile Services]
5. [Test the app against Mobile Services]

This tutorial requires the [Azure Mobile Services Component], [XCode 6.0][Install Xcode], [Xamarin.iOS], and iOS 7.0 or later versions.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A643EE910&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdevelop%2Fmobile%2Ftutorials%2Fget-started-with-data-xamarin-ios%2F"%20target="_blank).

## <a name="download-app"></a>Download the GetStartedWithData project

This tutorial is built on the [GetStartedWithData app][GitHub], which is a Xamarin.iOS app. The UI for this app is identical to the app generated by the Mobile Services Xamarin.iOS quickstart, except that added items are stored locally in memory.

1. Download the [GetStartedWithData app][GitHub].

2. In Xamarin Studio, open the downloaded project and examine the **TodoService** class.

   	Notice that there are several **// TODO** comments that specify the steps you must take to make this app work with your mobile service.

3. Go to the **Run** menu and choose **Start Without Debugging** to start the app.

4. In the app, type some text in the text box, then click the **+** button.

   	![][0]  

   	Notice that the saved text is displayed in the list below.

## <a name="create-service"></a>Create a new mobile service in the Management Portal

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-service-data](../includes/mobile-services-create-new-service-data.md)]

## <a name="add-table"></a>Add a new table to the mobile service

To be able to store app data in the new mobile service, you must first create a new table in the associated SQL Database instance.

1. In the Management Portal, click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.

2. Click the **Data** tab, then click **+Create**.

   	![][5]

   	This displays the **Create new table** dialog.

3. In **Table name** type _TodoItem_, then click the check button.

  	![][6]

  	This creates a new storage table **TodoItem** with the default permissions set, which means that any user of the app can access and change data in the table.

    > [AZURE.NOTE] The same table name is used in Mobile Services quickstart. However, each table is created in a schema that is specific to a given mobile service. This is to prevent data collisions when multiple mobile services use the same database.

4. Click the new **TodoItem** table and verify that there are no data rows.

5. Click the **Columns** tab and verify that there is only a single **id** column, which is automatically created for you.

	  This is the minimum requirement for a table in Mobile Services.

    > [AZURE.NOTE] When dynamic schema is enabled on your mobile service, new columns are created automatically when JSON objects are sent to the mobile service by an insert or update operation.

You are now ready to use the new mobile service as data storage for the app.

## <a name="update-app"></a>Update the app to use the mobile service for data access

Now that your mobile service is ready, you can update the app to store items in Mobile Services instead of the local collection.

1. If you don't already have **Azure Mobile Services** listed in the Components folder, you can get it by right-clicking **Components**, choosing **Get More Components** and then searching for **Azure Mobile Services**.

2. In the Solution view in Xamarin Studio, open the **TodoService** class and uncomment the following `using` statement:

        using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;

3. In the Management Portal, click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service you just created.

4. Click the **Dashboard** tab and make a note of the **Site URL**, then click **Manage keys** and make a note of the **Application key**.

   	![][8]

5. In the **Constants** class, uncomment the following constants:

        public const string ApplicationURL = @"AppUrl";
        public const string ApplicationKey = @"AppKey";

6. Replace **AppUrl** and **AppKey** in the above constants with the values you found above in the Management Portal.

7. In the **TodoService** class, uncomment the following line of code:

        private MobileServiceClient client;

   	This creates a property that represents the MobileServiceClient that connects to the service

8. In the **TodoService** class, uncomment the following line of code:

        private IMobileServiceTable<TodoItem> todoTable;  

   	This creates a property representation for your mobile services table.

9. Uncomment the following lines in the **TodoService** constructor:

		// TODO:: Uncomment these lines to use Mobile Services
		client = new MobileServiceClient(Constants.ApplicationURL, Constants.ApplicationKey).WithFilter(this);
		todoTable = client.GetTable<TodoItem>();

    This creates an instance of the Mobile Services client and creates the TodoItem table instance.

10. Uncomment the following lines in the **RefreshDataAsync** method in **TodoService**

			// TODO:: Uncomment these lines to use Mobile Services
			try
	    {
				// This code refreshes the entries in the list view by querying the TodoItems table.
				// The query excludes completed TodoItems
				Items = await todoTable
					.Where (todoItem => todoItem.Complete == false).ToListAsync();
			}
	    catch (MobileServiceInvalidOperationException e)
	    {
				Console.Error.WriteLine (@"ERROR {0}", e.Message);
				return null;
			}

    This creates a query to return all tasks that have not yet been completed.

11. Locate the **InsertTodoItemAsync** method, and uncomment the following line:

		await todoTable.InsertAsync(todoItem);

    This code sends an insert request to the mobile service.

13. Locate the **CompleteItemAsync** method, and uncomment the following line:

		await todoTable.UpdateAsync(item);

   	This code removes TodoItems after they are marked as completed.

Now that the app has been updated to use Mobile Services for backend storage, it's time to test the app against Mobile Services.

## <a name="test-app"></a>Test the app against your new mobile service

1. In Xamarin Studio, select an emulator or device to deploy to from one of the primary comboboxes, then go to the **Run** menu and select **Start WithoutDebugging** to start the app.

   	This executes your Azure Mobile Services client, built with Xamarin.iOS, that queries items from your mobile service.

2. As before, type text in the textbox, and then click the **+** button..

   	This sends a new item as an insert to the mobile service.

3. In the [Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your mobile service.

4. Click the **Data** tab, then click **Browse**.

   	![][9]

   	Notice that the **TodoItem** table now contains data, with id values generated by Mobile Services, and that columns have been automatically added to the table to match the TodoItem class in the app.

This concludes the **Get started with data** tutorial for Xamarin.iOS.
