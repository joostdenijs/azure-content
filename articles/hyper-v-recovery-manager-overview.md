# Azure Site Recovery Overview

<div class="dev-callout"> 
<p>Azure Site Recovery orchestrates replication and failover in a number of scenarios:</p>


<ul>
<li>**On-premises Hyper-V site to Azure protection with Hyper-V replication** — Orchestrate replication, failover, and recovery from an on-premises site with one or more Hyper-V servers but without System Center VMM. Virtual machine data is replicated from a source Hyper-V host server to Azure. Read <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=522298">Getting started with Azure Site Recovery: Protection Between an On-Premises Hyper-V Site and Azure with Hyper-V Replication</a>.</li>
<li>**On-premises VMM site to on-premises VMM site protection with Hyper-V replication** — Orchestrate replication, failover, and recovery between on-premises VMM sites. Virtual machine data is replicated from a source Hyper-V host server to a target host server. Read <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=398765">Getting started with Azure Site Recovery: Protection Between Two On-Premises VMM Sites with Hyper-V Replication</a>.</li>

<li>**On-premises VMM site to on-premises VMM site protection with SAN replication** — Orchestrates end-to-end replication, failover, and recovery using storage array-based replication between SAN devices that host virtual machine data in source and target on-premises sites. Read <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=518683">Getting started with Azure Site Recovery: : Protection Between Two On-Premises VMM Sites with SAN replication</a>.</li>

<li>**On-premises VMM site to Azure protection** — Orchestrate replication, failover, and recovery between an on-premises VMM site and Azure. Replicated virtual machine data is stored in Azure storage. Read <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=398764">Getting Started with Azure Site Recovery: Protection between an On-Premises VMM Site and Azure.</a></li>

<li>**On-premises VMWare site to on-premises VMWare site with InMage** — InMage Scout is a recent Microsoft acquisition that provides real-time replication between on-premises VMWare sites. Right now InMage is available as a separate product that's obtained via a subscription to the Azure Site Recovery service.
