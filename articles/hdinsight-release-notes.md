**Note**: The bug that prevented the full version number from showing up in the portal or from being returned by the SDK or by Windows PowerShell has been fixed in this release.

## Notes for 10/15/2014 release ##

This hotfix release fixed a memory leak in Templeton that affected the heavy users of Templeton. In some cases, users who exercised Templeton heavily would see errors manifested as 500 error codes because the requests would not have enough memory to run. The workaround for this issue was to restart the Templeton service. This issue has been fixed.


## Notes for 10/7/2014 release ##

* When using Ambari endpoint, "https://{clusterDns}.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/{clusterDns}.azurehdinsight.net/services/{servicename}/components/{componentname}", the *host_name* field returns the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the node instead of only the host name. For example, instead of returning "**headnode0**", you get the FQDN â**headnode0.{ClusterDNS}.azurehdinsight.net**â. This change was required to facilitate scenarios where multiple cluster types (such as HBase and Hadoop) can be deployed in one virtual network. This happens, for example, when using HBase as a back-end platform for Hadoop.

* We have provided new memory settings for the default deployment of the HDInsight cluster. Previous default memory settings did not adequately account for the guidance for the number of CPU cores being deployed. These new memory settings should provide better defaults (as per Hortonworks recommendations). To change these, please refer to the SDK reference documentation about changing cluster configuration. The new memory settings that are used by the default 4 CPU core (8 container) HDInsight cluster are itemized in the following table. (The values used prior to this release are also provided parenthetically.)

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Component</th><th>Memory Allocation</th></tr>
<tr><td> yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation</td><td>768 MB (previously 512 MB)</td></tr>
<tr><td> yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation</td><td>6144 MB (unchanged)</td></tr>

For more information about the memory configuration settings used by YARN and MapReduce on the Hortonworks Data Platform that is used by HDInsight, see [Determine HDP Memory Configuration Settings](http://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.1-latest/bk_installing_manually_book/content/rpm-chap1-11.html). Hortonworks also provided a tool to calculate proper memory settings.

Regarding the Azure PowerShell and the HDInsight SDK error message: "*Cluster is not configured for HTTP services access*":

* This error is a known [compatibility issue](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/a7de016d-8de1-4385-b89e-d2e7a1a9d927/hdinsight-powershellsdk-error-cluster-is-not-configured-for-http-services-access?forum=hdinsight) that may occur due to a difference in the version of the  HDInsight SDK or Azure PowerShell and the version of the cluster. Clusters created on 8/15 or later have support for new provisioning capability into virtual networks. But this capability is not correctly interpreted by older versions of the  HDInsight SDK or Azure PowerShell. The result is a failure in some job submission operations. If you use  HDInsight SDK APIs or Azure PowerShell cmdlets (**Use-AzureHDInsightCluster** or **Invoke-Hive**) to submit jobs, those operations may fail with the error message "*Cluster <clustername> is not configured for HTTP services access*." Or (depending on the operation), you may get other error messages, such as "*Cannot connect to cluster*".

* These compatibility issues are resolved in the latest versions of the HDInsight SDK and Azure PowerShell. We recommend updating the HDInsight SDK to version 1.3.1.6 or later and Azure PowerShell Tools to version 0.8.8 or later. You can get access to the latest HDInsight SDK from [](http://nuget.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Getting%20Started) and the Azure PowerShell Tools at [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure/).



## Notes for 9/12/2014 release of HDInsight 3.1##

* This release is based on Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) 2.1.5. For a list of the bugs fixed in this release, see the [Fixed in this Release](http://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.1.5/bk_releasenotes_hdp_2.1/content/ch_relnotes-hdp-2.1.5-fixed.html) page on the Hortonworks site.
* In the Pig libraries folder, the âavro-mapred-1.7.4.jarâ file has been changed to "avro-mapred-1.7.4-hadoop2.jar." The contents of this file contains a minor bug fix that is non-breaking. It is recommended that customers do not make a direct dependency on the name of the JAR file to avoid breaks when files are renamed.


## Notes for 8/21/2014 release ##

* We are adding the following WebHCat configuration (HIVE-7155), which sets the default memory limit for a Templeton controller job to 1 GB. (The previous default value was 512 MB.)

	 templeton.mapper.memory.mb (=1024)

	* This change addresses the following error which certain Hive queries had run in to due to lower memory limits: âContainer is running beyond physical memory limits.â
	* To revert to the old defaults, you can set this configuration value to 512 through Azure PowerShell at cluster creation time by using the following command:

		Add-AzureHDInsightConfigValues -Core @{"templeton.mapper.memory.mb"="512";}


* The host name of the zookeeper role was changed to *zookeeper*. This affects name resolution within the cluster, but it doesn't affect external REST APIs. If you have components that use the *zookeepernode* host name, you need to update them to use new name. The new names for the three zookeeper nodes are:
	* zookeeper0
	* zookeeper1
	* zookeeper2
* HBase version support matrix is updated. Only HDInsight version 3.1 (HBase version 0.98) is supported for production for HBase workloads. Version 3.0 (which was available for preview) is not supported moving forward.

## Notes about clusters created prior to 8/15/2014 ##

An Azure PowerShell or HDInsight SDK error message, "Cluster <clustername> is not configured for HTTP services access" (or depending on the operation, other error messages such as: "Cannot connect to cluster") may be encountered due to a version difference between Azure PowerShell or the HDInsight SDK and a cluster. Clusters created on 8/15 or later have support for new provisioning capability into virtual networks. This capability isnât correctly interpreted by older versions of the Azure PowerShell or the HDInsight SDK, which results in failures of job submission operations. If you use HDInsight SDK APIs or Azure PowerShell cmdlets (such as Use-AzureHDInsightCluster or Invoke-AzureHDInsightHiveJob) to submit jobs, those operations may fail with one of the error messages described.

These compatibility issues are resolved in the latest versions of the HDInsight SDK and Azure PowerShell. We recommend updating the HDInsight SDK to version 1.3.1.6 or later and Azure PowerShell Tools to version 0.8.8 or later. You can get access to the latest HDInsight SDK from [NuGet][nuget-link]. You can access the Azure PowerShell Tools by using [Microsoft Web Platform Installer][webpi-link].


## Notes for 7/28/2014 release ##

* **HDInsight available in new regions**:  We expanded HDInsight geographical presence to three regions. HDInsight customers can create clusters in these regions:
	* East Asia
	* North Central US
	* South Central US
* HDInsight version 1.6 (HDP 1.1 and Hadoop 1.0.3) and HDInsight version 2.1 (HDP1.3 and Hadoop 1.2) are being removed from the Azure portal. You can continue to create Hadoop clusters for these versions by using the Azure PowerShell cmdlet, [New-AzureHDInsightCluster](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn593744.aspx) or by using the [HDInsight SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn469975.aspx). Please refer to the [HDInsight component versioning](../hdinsight-component-versioning/) page for more information.
* Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) changes in this release:

<table border="1">
<tr><th>HDP</th><th>Changes</th></tr>
<tr><td>HDP 1.3 / HDI 2.1</td><td>No changes</td></tr>
<tr><td>HDP 2.0 / HDI 3.0</td><td>No changes</td></tr>
<tr><td>HDP 2.1 / HDI 3.1</td><td>zookeeper: ['3.4.5.2.1.3.0-1948'] -> ['3.4.5.2.1.3.2-0002']</td></tr>

## Notes for 6/24/2014 release ##

This release contains enhancements to the HDInsight service:

* **HDP 2.1 availability**: HDInsight 3.1 (which contains HDP 2.1) is generally available and is the default version for new clusters.
* **HBase â Azure portal improvements**: We are making HBase clusters available in Preview. You can create HBase clusters from the portal with three clicks:

![](http://i.imgur.com/cmOl5fM.png)

With HBase, you can build a variety of real-time workloads on HDInsight, from interactive websites that work with large datasets to services storing sensor and telemetry data from millions of end points. The next step would be to analyze the data in these workloads with Hadoop jobs, and this is possible in HDInsight through Azure PowerShell and the Hive cluster dashboard.

### Apache Mahout preinstalled on HDInsight 3.1 ###

 [Mahout](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/mahout/) is pre-installed on HDInsight 3.1 Hadoop clusters, so you can run Mahout jobs without the need for additional cluster configuration. For example, you can remote into an Hadoop cluster by using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), and without additional steps, you can run the following Hello World Mahout command:

		mahout org.apache.mahout.classifier.df.tools.Describe -p /user/hdp/glass.data -f /user/hdp/glass.info -d I 9 N L  

		mahout org.apache.mahout.classifier.df.BreimanExample -d /user/hdp/glass.data -ds /user/hdp/glass.info -i 10 -t 100

For a more complete explanation of this procedure, see the documentation for the [Breiman Example](https://mahout.apache.org/users/classification/breiman-example.html) on the Apache Mahout website.


### Hive queries can use Tez in HDInsight 3.1 ###

Hive 0.13 is available in HDInsight 3.1, and it is capable of running queries using Tez, which can be leveraged for substantial performance improvements.
Tez is not enable by default for Hive queries. To use it, you must opt in. You can enable Tez by running the following code snippet:

		set hive.execution.engine=tez;
		select sc_status, count(*), histogram_numeric(sc_bytes,5) from website_logs_orc_local group by sc_status;

Hortonworks has published a detailed breakdown of Hive query performance enhancements with Tez as delivered in standard benchmarks. For details, see [Benchmarking Apache Hive 13 for Enterprise Hadoop](http://hortonworks.com/blog/benchmarking-apache-hive-13-enterprise-hadoop/).

For more details about using Hive with Tez, see [Hive on Tez](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+on+Tez).

###Global availability
With the release of HDInsight on Hadoop 2.2, Microsoft has made HDInsight available in all major geographies where Azure is available. Specifically, the west Europe and southeast Asia datacenters have been brought online. This enables customers to locate clusters in a datacenter that is close and potentially in a zone of similar compliance requirements.


###Do's & Dont's between cluster versions

**Oozie metastores used with an HDInsight 3.1 cluster are not backward compatible with HDInsight 2.1 clusters, and they cannot be used with this previous version**.

A custom Oozie metastore database deployed with an HDInsight 3.1 cluster cannot be reused with an HDInsight 2.1 cluster. This is the case even if the metastore originated with an HDInsight 2.1 cluster. This scenario is not supported because the metastore schema gets upgraded when used with an  HDInsight 3.1 cluster, so it is no longer compatible with the metastore required by the HDInsight 2.1 clusters. Any attempt to reuse an Oozie metastore that has been used with an HDInsight 3.1 cluster will render the HDInsight 2.1 cluster useless.

**Oozie metastores cannot be shared across clusters.**

Oozie metastores are attached to specific clusters, and they cannot be shared across clusters.

###Breaking changes

**Prefix syntax**:
Only the "wasb://" syntax is supported in HDInsight 3.1 and 3.0 clusters. The older "asv://" syntax is supported in HDInsight 2.1 and 1.6 clusters, but it is not supported in HDInsight 3.1 or 3.0 clusters. This means that any jobs submitted to an HDInsight 3.1  or 3.0 cluster that explicitly use the "asv://" syntax will fail. The "wasb://" syntax should be used instead. Also, jobs submitted to any HDInsight 3.1 or 3.0 clusters that are created with an existing metastore that contains explicit references to resources using the "asv://" syntax will fail. These metastores need to be re-created using the "wasb://" syntax to address resources.


**Ports**: The ports used by the HDInsight service have changed. The port numbers that were being used were within the ephemeral port range of the Windows operating system. Ports are allocated automatically from a predefined ephemeral range for short-lived Internet protocol-based communications. The new set of allowed Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) service port numbers are outside this range to avoid encountering conflicts that could arise with the ports used by services running on the head node. The new port numbers should not cause any breaking changes. The numbers used are as follows:

 **HDInsight 1.6 (HDP 1.1)**
