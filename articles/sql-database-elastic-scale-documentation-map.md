# Azure SQL Database elastic database tools topics

The elastic database features of Azure SQL DB are designed to simplify data tier development and management especially for Software as a Service (SaaS) developersâ€”where large numbers of databases are used to support a dynamic end-customer base.  

**Elastic database tools** help you build and manage applications that utilize sharding patterns to scale-out across many databases. Included are the elastic database client library supporting shard management, data-dependent routing, and cross-shard query capabilities for ADO.Net. Also included is the split-merge tool that simplifies shard management by letting you move data (splitting) from one shard to another (merging).  These tools compliment Elastic database pools which enable predictable pricing with guaranteed performance characteristics for any number of databases. The associated job feature gives you an easy and reliable tool for upgrading and managing every database in the pool with T-SQL scripts.
