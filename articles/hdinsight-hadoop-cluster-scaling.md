#Scale Hadoop, HBase, or Apache Storm clusters to change their number of data nodes in HDInsight 

The cluster scaling feature allows you to change the number of data nodes used by a cluster that is running in Azure HDInsight without having to delete and re-create the cluster. The operation can be performed via Azure PowerShell, the HDInsight SDK, or the Azure portal.

## Feature details
This section describes the impact of changing the number of data nodes for each type of cluster supported by HDInsight:

* Hadoop
* Apache Storm
* HBase 

## Hadoop 

### Adding data nodes
You can seamlessly increase the number of data nodes in a Hadoop cluster that is running without impacting any pending or running jobs. New jobs can also be submitted while the operation is in progress. Failures in a scaling operation are gracefully handled so that the cluster is always left in a functional state.

### Removing data nodes
When a Hadoop cluster is scaled down by reducing the number of data nodes, some of the services in the cluster are restarted. This causes all running and pending jobs to fail at the completion of the scaling operation. You can, however, resubmit the jobs once the operation is complete.

## Storm
You can seamlessly add or remove data nodes to your Storm cluster while it is running. But after a successful completion of the scaling operation, you will need to rebalance the topology.

Rebalancing can be accomplished in two ways:

* Storm web UI
* Command-line interface (CLI) tool 

Please refer to the [Apache Storm documentation](http://storm.apache.org/documentation/Understanding-the-parallelism-of-a-Storm-topology.html) for more details.

The Storm web UI is available on the HDInsight cluster:

Here is an example how to use the CLI command to rebalance the Storm topology:

	## Reconfigure the topology "mytopology" to use 5 worker processes,
	## the spout "blue-spout" to use 3 executors, and
	## the bolt "yellow-bolt" to use 10 executors

	$ storm rebalance mytopology -n 5 -e blue-spout=3 -e yellow-bolt=10

##HBase
You can seamlessly add or remove nodes to your HBase cluster while it is running. Regional Servers are automatically balanced within a few minutes of completing the scaling operation. However, you can also manually balance the regional servers by logging into the headnode of cluster and running the following commands from a command prompt window:

	>pushd %HBASE_HOME%\bin
	>hbase shell
	>balancer

## Prerequisites

* Only clusters with HDInsight version 3.1.3 or higher are supported. If you are unsure of the version of your cluster, you can check the cluster version from the Azure portal by clicking the HDInsight cluster name or by running the `Get-AzureHDInsightCluster –name <clustername>` command from Azure PowerShell.

* Azure PowerShell version 0.8.14 or higher is required to perform the operation from Azure PowerShell. You can download the latest version of Azure PowerShell from the **Command-line tools** section on the [Azure Downloads](http://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/) website. You can check on the Azure PowerShell version you have installed by using the following command from an Azure PowerShell window: `(get-module Azure).Version`

## How to use cluster scaling

### Azure portal
The size of a running cluster can be changed from the **SCALE** tab of Azure HDInsight cluster dashboard.

### Azure PowerShell
To change the Hadoop cluster size by using Azure PowerShell, run the following command from a client machine:

	Set-AzureHDInsightClusterSize -ClusterSizeInNodes <NewSize> -name <clustername>	

> [AZURE.NOTE] The client machine must have Azure PowerShell version 0.8.14 or higher installed to use this command.

### SDK
To change the Hadoop cluster size by using the HDInsight SDK, use one of the following methods: 

	ChangeClusterSize(string dnsName, string location, int newSize) 

or 

	ChangeClusterSizeAsync(string dnsName, string location, int newSize) 


Both synchronous and asynchronous versions of this method return a [ClusterDetails](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.windowsazure.management.hdinsight.clusterdetails_properties.aspx) object.

Here is some sample code that shows how to use the synchronous version of this method:

	using System;
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using System.Linq;
	using System.Text;
	using System.Threading.Tasks;
	using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Management.HDInsight;
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Management.HDInsight.ClusterProvisioning;

	namespace HDInsightClusterScaling
	{
	    class Program
	    {
	        static void Main(string[] args)
	        {
	            // Friendly name for the certificate your created earlier  
	            string certfriendlyname = "<CertificateFriendlyName>";     
	            string subscriptionid = "<SubscriptionID>";
	            string clustername = "<ClusterDNSName>";
	     		string location = "<ClusterLocation>”";
				int newSize = <NewClusterSize>;
	
	            // Get the certificate object from certificate store by using the friendly name to identify it
	            X509Store store = new X509Store();
	            store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);
	            X509Certificate2 cert = store.Certificates.Cast<X509Certificate2>().First(item => item.FriendlyName == certfriendlyname);
	
	            // Create an HDInsightClient object
	            HDInsightCertificateCredential creds = new HDInsightCertificateCredential(new Guid(subscriptionid), cert);
	            var client = HDInsightClient.Connect(creds);
	
	            Console.WriteLine("Rescaling HDInsight cluster ...");
	
	            // Change the cluster size
	     		ClusterDetails cluster = client.ChangeClusterSize(clustername, location, newSize);
	            
	            Console.WriteLine("Cluster Rescaled: {0} \n New Cluster Size = {1}", cluster.ConnectionUrl, cluster.ClusterSizeInNodes);
	            Console.WriteLine("Press ENTER to continue.");
	            Console.ReadKey();
	        }
	    }
	}
