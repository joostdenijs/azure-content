# Release Notes for Application Insights SDK for ASP.NET


## Version 0.16 

2015-04-28 preview

- SDK now supports DNX target platform to enable monitoring of [.NET Core framework](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/NETCore5) applications.
- Instances of ```TelemetryClient``` do not cache Instrumentation Key anymore. Now if instrumentation key wasn't set in ```TelemetryClient``` explicitly ```InstrumentationKey``` will return null. It fixes an issue when you set ```TelemetryConfiguration.Active.InstrumentationKey``` after some telemetry was already collected, telemetry modules like dependency collector, web requests data collection and performance counters collector will use new instrumentation key.

## Version 0.15

- New property ```Operation.SyntheticSource``` now available on ```TelemetryContext```. Now you can mark your telemetry items as "not a real user traffic" and specify how this traffic was generated. As an example by setting this property you can distinguish traffic from your test automation from load test traffic.
- Channel logic was moved to the separate NuGet called Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.PersistenceChannel. Default channel is now called InMemoryChannel
- New method ```TelemetryClient.Flush``` allows to flush telemetry items from the buffer synchronously

## Version 0.13

No release notes for older versions available.
