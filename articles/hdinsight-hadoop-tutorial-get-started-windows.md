# Hadoop tutorial: Get started with a Hive query in HDInsight on Windows

> [AZURE.SELECTOR]
- [Windows](hdinsight-get-started.md)
- [Linux](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-get-started.md)

To help you learn Hadoop on Windows and start using HDInsight quickly, this tutorial shows you how to run a Hive query on unstructured data in a Hadoop cluster. You'll extract meaningful information about mobile handset use, and then you’ll analyze the results in Microsoft Excel.


> [AZURE.NOTE] If you are new to Hadoop and Big Data, you can read more about the terms [Apache Hadoop][apache-hadoop], [MapReduce][apache-mapreduce], [HDFS][apache-hdfs], and  [Hive][apache-hive]. To lunderstand how HDInsight enables Hadoop in Azure, see [Introduction to Hadoop in HDInsight][hadoop-hdinsight-intro].

In conjunction with the general availability of Azure HDInsight, Microsoft also provides HDInsight Emulator for Azure, formerly known as *Microsoft HDInsight Developer Preview*. The Emulator targets developer scenarios and only supports single-node deployments. For information about using HDInsight Emulator, see [Get Started with the HDInsight Emulator][hdinsight-emulator].

> [AZURE.NOTE] For instructions on how to provision an HBase cluster, see [Provision HBase cluster in HDInsight][hdinsight-hbase-custom-provision]. See <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=510237">What's the difference between Hadoop and HBase?</a> to understand why you might choose one database over the other.   

## What does this Hadoop tutorial accomplish? 

Assume you have a large unstructured data set and you want to run a Hive query on it to extract some meaningful information. That's exactly what we are going to do in this tutorial. Here's how we achieve this:

**[Watch the Hadoop tutorial for HDInsight on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4aNjnoeaHA&list=PLDrz-Fkcb9WWdY-Yp6D4fTC1ll_3lU-QS)**


## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial for Hadoop on Windows, you must have the following:


- An Azure subscription. For more information about obtaining a subscription, see [Purchase Options][azure-purchase-options], [Member Offers][azure-member-offers], or [Free Trial][azure-free-trial].
- A computer with Office 2013 Professional Plus, Office 365 Pro Plus, Excel 2013 Standalone, or Office 2010 Professional Plus.

**Estimated time to complete this tutorial:** 30 minutes



##<a name="storage"></a>Create an Azure Storage account

HDInsight uses Azure Blob storage for storing data. For more information, see [Use Azure Blob storage with HDInsight][hdinsight-storage].

When you provision a Hadoop cluster in HDInsight, you specify an Azure Storage account. A specific Blob storage container from that account is designated as the default file system, like in the Hadoop distribute file system (HDFS). By default, the HDInsight cluster is provisioned in the same datacenter as the storage account you specify.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Don't share a default Blob storage container with multiple Hadoop clusters. 

In addition to this storage account, you can add additional storage accounts when you custom configure a cluster. This additional storage account can be from the same Azure subscription or from different Azure subscriptions. For instructions, see [Provision HDInsight clusters using custom options][hdinsight-provision]. 

To simplify this tutorial, only the default blob and the default storage account are used. In practice, the data files are usually stored in a designated storage account.

**To create an Azure Storage account**

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal][azure-management-portal].
2. Click **NEW** in the lower-left corner, point to **DATA SERVICES**, point to **STORAGE**, and then click **QUICK CREATE**.

	![Azure portal where you can use Quick Create to set up a new storage account.][image-hdi-storageaccount-quickcreate]

3. Enter **URL**, **LOCATION**, and **REPLICATION** information, and then click **CREATE STORAGE ACCOUNT**. (Affinity groups are not supported.) You will see the new storage account in the storage list.

	>[AZURE.NOTE]  The QUICK CREATE option to provision an HDInsight cluster (like the one we use in this tutorial) does not ask for a location when you are provisioning the cluster. Instead, by default, it co-locates the cluster in the same datacenter as the storage account. So, make sure you create your storage account in a location that is supported for the cluster. These are:  **East Asia**, **Southeast Asia**, **North Europe**, **West Europe**, **East US**, **West US**, **North Central US**, **South Central US**.

4. Wait until the **STATUS** of the new storage account changes to **Online**.
5. Select the new storage account from the list and click **MANAGE ACCESS KEYS** at the bottom of the page.
7. Make a note of the **STORAGE ACCOUNT NAME** and the **PRIMARY ACCESS KEY** (or the **SECONDARY ACCESS KEY**—either of the keys work).  You will need them later in the tutorial.


For more information, see
[How to Create a Storage Account][azure-create-storageaccount] and [Use Azure Blob Storage with HDInsight][hdinsight-storage].
	
##<a name="provision"></a>Provision a Hadoop cluster

When you provision a cluster, you provision Azure compute resources that contain Hadoop and related applications. In this section, you provision an HDInsight version 3.1 cluster, which is based on Hadoop version 2.4. You can also create Hadoop clusters for other versions by using the Azure portal, HDInsight PowerShell cmdlets, or the HDInsight .NET SDK. For instructions, see [Provision HDInsight clusters using custom options][hdinsight-provision]. For information about HDInsight versions and their SLAs, see [HDInsight component versioning](hdinsight-component-versioning.md).

[AZURE.INCLUDE [provisioningnote](../includes/hdinsight-provisioning.md)]


**To provision a Hadoop cluster** 

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal][azure-management-portal]. 

2. Click **HDInsight** in the left pane to list the status of the clusters in your account. In the following screenshot, there are no existing HDInsight clusters.

	![Status of HDInsight clusters in the Azure portal.][image-hdi-clusterstatus]

3. Click **NEW** in the lower-left corner, click **Data Services**, click **HDInsight**, and then click **Hadoop**.

	![Creation of a Hadoop cluster in HDInsight.][image-hdi-quickcreatecluster]

4. Enter or select the following values:

	<table border="1">
	<tr><th>Name</th><th>Value</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Cluster Name</td><td>Name of the cluster.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Cluster Size</td><td>Number of data nodes you want to deploy. The default value is 4. But the option to use 1 or 2 data nodes is also available from the drop-down list. Any number of cluster nodes can be specified by using the <strong>Custom Create</strong> option. Pricing details about the billing rates for various cluster sizes are available. Click the <strong>?</strong> symbol above the drop-down list and follow the link that appears.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Password</td><td>The password for the <i>admin</i> account. The cluster user name "admin" is specified when you are not using the <strong>Custom Create</strong> option. Note that this is NOT the Windows Administrator account for the VMs on which the clusters are provisioned. The account name can be changed by using the <strong>Custom Create</strong> wizard.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Storage Account</td><td>Click the drop-down list, and select the storage account that you created. <br/>

	When a storage account is chosen, it cannot be changed. If the storage account is removed, the cluster will no longer be available for use.

	The HDInsight cluster is located in the same datacenter as the storage account. 
	</td></tr>
	</table>

	Keep a copy of the cluster name. You will need it later in the tutorial.

	
5. Click **Create HDInsight Cluster**. When the provisioning completes, the  status column shows **Running**.

	>[AZURE.NOTE] The previous procedure creates a Hadoop cluster by using HDInsight version 3.1. To create cluster with other versions, use the **Custom Create** method from the portal or use Azure PowerShell. For information about what's different between each version, see [What's new in the cluster versions provided by HDInsight?][hdinsight-versions]. For information about using the **CUSTOM CREATE** option, see [Provision HDInsight clusters using custom options][hdinsight-provision].


##<a name="sample"></a>Run sample data from the portal

A successfully provisioned HDInsight cluster provides a query console that includes a Getting Started gallery to run samples directly from the portal. You can use the samples to learn how to work with HDInsight by walking through some basic scenarios. These samples come with all the required components, such as the data to analyze and the queries to run on the data. To learn more about the samples in the Getting Started gallery, see [Learn Hadoop in HDInsight using the HDInsight Getting Started Gallery](hdinsight-learn-hadoop-use-sample-gallery.md).

**To run the sample**, from the Azure portal, click the cluster name where you want to run the sample, and then click **Query Console** at the bottom of the page. From the webpage that opens, click the **Getting Started Gallery** tab, and then under the **Samples** category, click the sample that you want to run. Follow the instructions on the webpage to finish the sample. The following table lists a couple of samples and provides more information about what each sample does.

##<a name="hivequery"></a>Run a Hive query from the portal
Now that you have provisioned an HDInsight cluster, the next step is to run a Hive job to query a sample Hive table. We will use *hivesampletable*, which comes with HDInsight clusters. The table contains data about mobile device manufacturers, platforms, and models. A Hive query on this table retrieves data for mobile devices by a specific manufacturer.

> [AZURE.NOTE] HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio comes with the Azure SDK for .NET version 2.5 or later. By using the tools in Visual Studio, you can connect to HDInsight cluster, create Hive tables, and run Hive queries. For more information, see [Get started using HDInsight Hadoop Tools for Visual Studio][1].

**To run a Hive job from the cluster dashboard**

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal][azure-management-portal]. 
2. Click **HDINSIGHT** from the left pane. You will see a list of clusters, including the cluster you just created in the previous section.
3. Click the name of the cluster that you want to use to run the Hive job, and then click **QUERY CONSOLE** at the bottom of the page. 
4. A webpage opens in a different browser tab. Enter the Hadoop user account and password. The default user name is **admin**; the password is what you entered while provisioning the cluster. The dashboard looks like this:

	![Hive Editor tab in the HDInsight cluster dashboard.][img-hdi-dashboard]

	There are several tabs at the top of the page. The default tab is **Hive Editor**, and the other tabs are **Job History** and **File Browser**. By using the dashboard, you can submit Hive queries, check Hadoop job logs, and browse files in storage.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] Note that the URL of the webpage is *&lt;ClusterName&gt;.azurehdinsight.net*. So instead of opening the dashboard from the portal, you can open the dashboard from a web browser by using the URL.

6. On the **Hive Editor** tab, for **Query Name**, enter **HTC20**.  The query name is the job title.

7. In the query pane, enter the following Hive query: 

		SELECT * FROM hivesampletable
			WHERE devicemake LIKE "HTC%"
			LIMIT 20;

	![Hive query entered in the query pane of the Hive Editor.][img-hdi-dashboard-query-select]

4. Click **Submit**. It takes a few moments to get the results back. The screen refreshes every 30 seconds. You can also click **Refresh** to refresh the screen.

    When the job completes, the screen looks like this:

	![Results from a Hive query in listed at the bottom of the cluster dashboard.][img-hdi-dashboard-query-select-result]

5. Click the query name on the screen to see the output. Make a note of **Job Start Time (UTC)**. You will need it later. 

    ![Job Start Time listed in the Job History tab of the HDInsight cluster dashboard.][img-hdi-dashboard-query-select-result-output]

    The page also shows the **Job Output** and the **Job Log**. You also have the option to download the output file (\_stdout) and the log file \(_stderr).


	> [AZURE.NOTE] The **Job Session** table on the **Hive Editor** tab lists completed or running jobs if you stay on that tab. The table does not list any jobs if you navigate away from the page. The **Job History** tab maintains a list of all jobs, completed or running.
 

**To browse to the output file**

1. On the cluster dashboard, click **File Browser**. 
2. Click your storage account name, click your container name (which is the same as your cluster name), and then click **user**.
3. Click **admin** and then click the GUID that has the last modified time (a little after the job start time you noted earlier). Copy this GUID. You will need it in the next section.


   	![The Hive query output file GUID listed in the File Browser tab.][img-hdi-dashboard-query-browse-output]


##<a name="powerquery"></a>Connect to Microsoft business intelligence tools for Excel 

You can use the Power Query add-in for Microsoft Excel to import the job output from HDInsight into Excel, where Microsoft business intelligence tools can be used to further analyze the results. 

You must have Excel 2013 or 2010 installed to complete this part of the tutorial. 

**To download Microsoft Power Query for Excel**

- Download Microsoft Power Query for Microsoft Excel from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39379) and install it.

**To import HDInsight data**

1. Open Excel, and create a new workbook.
3. Click the **Power Query** menu, click **From Other Sources**, and then click **From Azure HDInsight**.

	![Excel PowerQuery Import menu open for Azure HDInsight.][image-hdi-gettingstarted-powerquery-importdata]

3. Enter the **Account Name** of the Azure Blob Storage account that is associated with your cluster, and then click **OK**. (This is the storage account you created earlier in the tutorial.)
4. Enter the **Account Key** for the Azure Blob Storage account, and then click **Save**. 
5. In the right pane, double-click the blob name. By default the blob name is the same as the cluster name. 

6. Locate **stdout** in the **Name** column. Verify that the GUID in the corresponding **Folder Path** column matches the GUID you copied earlier. A match suggests that the output data corresponds to the job you submitted. Click **Binary** in the column left of **stdout**.

	![Finding the data output by GUID in the list of content.][image-hdi-gettingstarted-powerquery-importdata2]

9. Click **Close & Load** in the upper-left corner to import the Hive job output into Excel.
