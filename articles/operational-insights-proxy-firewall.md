# Configure proxy and firewall settings for Operational Insights

[AZURE.INCLUDE [operational-insights-note-moms](../includes/operational-insights-note-moms.md)]

Actions needed to configure proxy and firewall settings for Operational Insights differ when you use Operations Manager and it’s agents versus Microsoft Monitoring agents that connect directly to servers. Review the following sections for the type of agent that you use.

## Configure proxy and firewall settings with the Microsoft Monitoring agent

For the Microsoft Monitoring agent to connect to and register with the Operational Insights service, it must have access to the port number of your domains and the URLs. If you use a proxy server for communication between the agent and the Operational Insights service, you’ll need to ensure that the appropriate resources are accessible. If you use a firewall to restrict access to the Internet, you need to configure your firewall to permit access to Operational Insights. The following tables list the ports that Operational Insights needs.

<table border="1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">
    <tbody>
    <tr align="left" valign="top">
		<td><b>Agent Resource</b></td>
		<td><b>Ports</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="left" valign="top">
		<td>*.ods.opinsights.azure.com</td>
		<td>Port 443</td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="left" valign="top">
		<td>*.oms.opinsights.azure.com</td>
		<td>Port 443</td>
    </tr>
	<tr align="left" valign="top">
		<td>ods.systemcenteradvisor.com</td>
		<td>Port 443</td>
    </tr>
	    <tr align="left" valign="top">
		<td>*.blob.core.windows.net/*</td>
		<td>Port 443</td>
    </tr>

Use the following procedure to create a PowerShell script that you can run to set the proxy settings for each agent that connects directly to servers.

### To configure proxy settings for the Microsoft Monitoring agent


Copy the following sample, update it with information specific to your environment, save it with a PS1 file name extension, and then run the script on each computer that connects directly to the Operational Insights service.


    param($ProxyDomainName="http://proxy.contoso.com:80", $cred=(Get-Credential))

    # First we get the health service configuration object.  We need to determine if we
    # have the right update rollup with the API we need.  If not, no need to run the rest of the script.
    $healthServiceSettings = New-Object -ComObject 'AgentConfigManager.MgmtSvcCfg'

    $proxyMethod = $healthServiceSettings | Get-Member -Name 'SetProxyInfo'

    if (!$proxyMethod)
    {
        Write-Output 'Health Service proxy API not present, will not update settings.'
        return
    }


    Write-Output "Clearing proxy settings."
    $healthServiceSettings.SetProxyInfo('', '', '')

    $ProxyUserName = $cred.username;


    Write-Output "Setting Proxy to ${ProxyDomainName} with proxy username of (${ProxyUserName})."
    $healthServiceSettings.SetProxyInfo($ProxyDomainName, $ProxyUserName, $cred.GetNetworkCredential().password)

## Configure proxy and firewall settings with Operations Manager

For an Operations Manager management group to connect to and register with the Operational Insights service, it must have access to the port number of your domains and the URLs. If you use a proxy server for communication between the Operations Manager management server and the Operational Insights service, you’ll need to ensure that the appropriate resources are accessible. If you use a firewall to restrict access to the Internet, you need to configure your firewall to permit access to Operational Insights. The following tables list the ports related to these tasks.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Some of the following resources mention Advisor. However, the listed resources will change in the future.

Use the following procedures to register your Operations Manager management group with the Operational Insights service. If you are having communication problems between the management group and the Operational Insights service, use the validation procedures to troubleshoot data transmission to the Operational Insights service.

### To request exceptions for the Operational Insights service endpoints

1. Use the information from the first table presented previously to ensure that the resources needed for the Operations Manager management server are accessible through any firewalls you might have.

2. Use the information from the second table presented previously to ensure that the resources needed for the Operations console in Operations Manager and Operational Insights are accessible through any firewalls you might have.

3. If you use a proxy server with Internet Explorer, ensure that it is configured and works correctly. To verify, you can open a secure web connection (https), for example [https://bing.com](https://bing.com). If the secure web connection doesn’t work in a browser, it probably won’t work in the Operations Manager management console with web services in the cloud.

### To configure the proxy server in the Operations Manager console

1. Open the Operations Manager console and select the **Administration** workspace.

2. Expand **Operational Insights**, and then select **Operational Insights Connection**.

3. In the Operational Insights Connection view, click **Configure Proxy Server**.

4. In Operational Insights Settings Wizard: Proxy Server, select **Use a proxy server to access the Operational Insights Web Service**, and then type the URL with the port number, for example, **http://myproxy:80**.

### To specify credentials if the proxy server requires authentication

1. Open the Operations Manager console and select the **Administration** workspace.

2. Under **RunAs Configuration**, select **Profiles**.

3. Open the **Operational Insights Run As Profile Proxy** profile.

4. In the Run As Profile Wizard, click **Add** to use a Run As account. You can create a new Run As account or use an existing account. This account needs to have sufficient permissions to pass through the proxy server.

5. To set the account to manage, choose **A selected class, group, or object**, and then select **Operations Manager Management Servers**.

6. Complete the wizard and save the changes.

### To configure the proxy server on each management server for WinHTTP

1. If Operations Manager has not been updated with Operations Manager 2012 R2 Update Rollup 3 or Operations Manager 2012 SP1 Update rollup 7 or later, open a Command Prompt window as an administrator on the Operations Manager management server. Otherwise, you don’t need to use this procedure.

2. Type **netsh winhttp set proxy myproxy:80**.

3. Close the Command Prompt window, and restart the System Center Management service (HealthService).

4. Perform step 2 on each management server in your management group.

### To configure the proxy server on each management server

1. Open the Operations Manager console and select the **Administration** workspace.

2. Select **Device Management**, and then click **Management Servers**.

3. Right-click the name of each management server, click **Properties**, and then set the information on the **Proxy Settings** tab.

### To validate that Operational Insights management packs are downloaded

1. If you added solutions by using Operational Insights, you can view them in the Operations Manager console as management packs under **Administration**. Search for Operational Insights to quickly find them.

2. You can also check for Operational Insights management packs by using the following Windows PowerShell commands in the Operations Manager management server:

        get-scommanagementpack | where {$_.DisplayName -match 'Advisor'} | select Name,DisplayName,Version,KeyToken

        get-scommanagementpack | where {$_.DisplayName -match 'Advisor'} | select Name,DisplayName,Version | ft

### To validate that Operations Manager is sending data to the Operational Insights service

1. In the Operations Manager management server, open Performance Monitor (perfmon.exe), and select **Performance Monitor**.

2. Click **Add**, and then select **Health Service Management Group**s.

3. Add all the counters that start with **HTTP**.

4. If your Operations Manager configuration is good, you will see activity for Health Service Management counters for events and other data items, based on the management packs that you added in Operational Insights and the configured log collection policy.
