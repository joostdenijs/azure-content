# Learn more about Azure AD

[What is Azure AD?](active-directory-whatis.md)<br>
[How does it work?](active-directory-works.md)<br>
[Get started](active-directory-get-started.md)<br>
[Next steps](active-directory-next-steps.md)

I already have an Azure subscription. How is Azure AD related to that? [How subscriptions are associated with a directory](active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory.md)

For Azure AD administrative tasks such as user management, domain management, or configuring single sign-on, use the Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell cmdlets. [Manage Azure AD using Windows PowerShell](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj151815.aspx)

Use the Azure Active Directory Graph API for programmatic access to Azure AD through REST API endpoints. [Azure AD Graph API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh974476.aspx)

You can add your own custom domain name to Azure Active Directory to use it with Microsoft online services. [Internet domain management](active-directory-add-domain.md)

To understand usage constraints and other service limits for the Azure Active Directory service, see [Azure AD service limits and restrictions](active-directory-service-limits-restrictions.md)
