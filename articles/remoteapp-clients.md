# Accessing your apps

One of the beauty of RemoteApp is that you can access apps published to you from any of your devices. Even better, you can start working on one device and then seamlessly transition to a second device and pick up right where you left off. To get started you need to download the appropriate client for your device and sign in to the service.

In this topic, we'll review the list of clients currently supported and how to download them before I show you how to sign in to RemoteApp from each of the clients.

## Supported clients

You can access RemoteApp using the steps below if your device is running one of these operating systems:

 - Windows 10 preview
 - Windows 8.1
 - Windows 8
 - Windows 7 Service Pack 1
 - Windows RT
 - Windows Phone 8.1
 - iOS
 - Mac OS X
 - Android


 What about thin clients? The following Windows Embedded thin clients are supported:

 - Windows Embedded Standard 7 with Service Pack 1
 - Windows Embedded POSReady7

## Downloading the client

No matter what platform you are using, the client you need to access RemoteApp can be found on the [Remote Desktop client download](https://www.remoteapp.windowsazure.com/ClientDownload/AllClients.aspx) page.

Clicking the different links will either directly start downloading the client or will send you to the client download page in the app store for that platform. Install the client by following the instructions on the screen.

Once you have installed the client on your device and launched it, jump to the corresponding section below to learn how to sign in to RemoteApp from that client.
