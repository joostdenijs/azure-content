# Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Algorithm Cheat Sheet

[Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/) comes with a large number of machine learning algorithms that you can use to build your predictive analytics solutions. These algorithms fall into the general machine learning categories of ***regression***, ***classification***, ***clustering***, and ***anomaly detection***, and each one is designed to address a different type of machine learning problem.

The question is, is there something that can help me quickly figure out how to choose a machine learning algorithm for my specific solution?

The **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Algorithm Cheat Sheet** is designed to help you sift through the available machine learning algorithms and choose the appropriate one to use for your predictive analytics solution.
The cheat sheet asks you questions about both the nature of your data and the problem you're working to address, and then suggests an algorithm for you to try.

[Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/) gives you the flexibility to experiment - 
try one algorithm, and if you're not satisfied with the results, try another.
Here's an example from the [Azure Machine Learning Gallery](http://gallery.azureml.net) of an experiment that tries several algorithms against the same data and compares the results:
[Compare Multi-class Classifiers: Letter recognition](http://gallery.azureml.net/Details/a635502fc98b402a890efe21cec65b92).

For a deeper discussion of the different types of machine learning algorithms and how they're used, see [How to choose an algorithm in Azure Machine Learning](machine-learning-algorithm-choice.md).
For a list of all the machine learning algorithms available in Machine Learning Studio, see [Initialize Model][initialize-model] in the Machine Learning Studio Algorithm and Module Help.
