# Get help from Machine Learning Live Chat Support
[Azure Machine Learning Studio](machine-learning-what-is-ml-studio.md) provides an intuitive interface for building machine learning models. There is a [Gallery](machine-learning-gallery-how-to-use-contribute-publish.md) and [Forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/home?forum=MachineLearning) to guide you along that way. 

But sometimes you just need to ask a quick question to unblock you. In [Studio](machine-learning-what-is-ml-studio.md) look for the chat icon in the top navigation.  If you see this icon, that means a member of the product team is online to help you in real time.
