# Call a custom API from the client

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-call-custom-api](../includes/mobile-services-selector-call-custom-api.md)]

This topic shows you how to call a custom API from an Android app. A custom API enables you to define custom endpoints that expose server functionality that does not map to an insert, update, delete, or read operation. By using a custom API, you can have more control over messaging, including reading and setting HTTP message headers and defining a message body format other than JSON.

The custom API created in this topic enables you to send a single POST request that sets the *completed* flag to `true` for all the todo items in your mobile service's table. Without this custom API, the client would have to send individual requests to update the flag for each todo item in the table.

You will add this functionality to the app that you created when you completed either the [Get started with Mobile Services] or the [Get started with data] tutorial. 

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete [Get started with Mobile Services].
