# Install the Azure CLI for Mac, Linux, and Windows

This document describes how to install the Azure Command-Line Interface (also called the _xplat-cli_) on Mac, Linux, and Windows. The Azure CLI provides a set of open source shell-based commands for managing resources on Microsoft Azure.

> [AZURE.NOTE] If you've already installed the Azure CLI, connect it with your Azure resources. For more, see [How to connect to your Azure Subscription](xplat-cli-connect.md#configure).

The xplat-cli is written in JavaScript, and requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). It is implemented using the [Azure SDK for Node](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-node), and released under an Apache 2.0 license. The project repository is located at [https://github.com/Azure/azure-xplat-cli](https://github.com/Azure/azure-xplat-cli).

## How to install the Azure CLI for Mac, Linux, and Windows

There are few ways to install the Azure CLI.

1. Using an installer
2. Installing Node.js and npm and then using the **npm install** command
3. Run Azure CLI as a Docker container 

Once the Azure CLI has been installed, you will be able to use the **azure** command from your command-line interface (Bash, Terminal, Command prompt) to access the Azure CLI commands.

## Using an installer

The following installer packages are available:

* [Windows installer][windows-installer]

* [OS X installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=252249)

* [Linux installer][linux-installer]


## Installing and using Node.js and npm

If Node.js is already installed on your system, use the following command to install the Azure CLI:

	npm install azure-cli -g

> [AZURE.NOTE] On Linux distributions, you may need to use `sudo` to successfully run the __npm__ command.

### Installing node.js and npm on Linux distributions that use [dpkg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dpkg) package management
The most common of these distributions use either the [advanced packaging tool (apt)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool) or other tools based on the `.deb` package format. Some examples are Ubuntu and Debian.

Most of the more recent of these distributions require installing **nodejs-legacy** in order to get a properly configured **npm** tool to install the Azure CLI. The following code shows the commands that install **npm** properly on Ubuntu 14.04.

	sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy
	sudo apt-get install npm
	sudo npm install -g azure-cli

Some of the older distributions, such as Ubuntu 12.04, require installing the current binary distribution of node.js. The following code shows how to do that by installing and using **curl**.

>[AZURE.NOTE] The commands here are taken from the Joyent installation instructions found [here](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/installing-node.js-via-package-manager). However, when using **sudo** as a pipe target, you should always check the scripts that you are installing and validate that they do exactly what you expect before running them through **sudo**. With great power comes great responsibility.

	sudo apt-get install curl
	curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
	sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
	sudo npm install -g azure-cli

### Installing node.js and npm on Linux distributions that use [rpm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager) package management

Installing node.js on RPM-based distributions requires enabling the EPEL repository. The following code shows the best practices for installation on CentOS 7. (Note that in the first line below, the '-' (hyphen) is important!)

	su -
	yum update [enter]
	yum upgrade â€“y [enter]
	yum install epel-release [enter]
	yum install nodejs [enter]
	yum install npm [enter]
	npm install -g azure-cli  [enter]

### Installing node.js and npm on Windows and Mac OS X

You can install node.js and npm on Windows and OS X using the installers from [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/download/). You might need to restart the computer to complete the installation. Check if node and npm was installed properly by opening command prompt and typing

	npm -v

If it shows the version of the npm installed, you can go ahead and install Azure CLI with

	npm install -g azure-cli

Once the Azure CLI has been installed, you will be able to use the **azure** command from your command-line user interface (Bash, Terminal, cmd.exe, and so on) to access the Azure CLI commands. At the end of the installation, you should see something similar to the following:

	azure-cli@0.8.0 ..\node_modules\azure-cli
	|-- easy-table@0.0.1
	|-- eyes@0.1.8
	|-- xmlbuilder@0.4.2
	|-- colors@0.6.1
	|-- node-uuid@1.2.0
	|-- async@0.2.7
	|-- underscore@1.4.4
	|-- tunnel@0.0.2
	|-- omelette@0.1.0
	|-- github@0.1.6
	|-- commander@1.0.4 (keypress@0.1.0)
	|-- xml2js@0.1.14 (sax@0.5.4)
	|-- streamline@0.4.5
	|-- winston@0.6.2 (cycle@1.0.2, stack-trace@0.0.7, async@0.1.22, pkginfo@0.2.3, request@2.9.203)
	|-- kuduscript@0.1.2 (commander@1.1.1, streamline@0.4.11)
	|-- azure@0.7.13 (dateformat@1.0.2-1.2.3, envconf@0.0.4, mpns@2.0.1, mime@1.2.10, validator@1.4.0, xml2js@0.2.8, wns@0.5.3, request@2.25.0)

>[AZURE.NOTE] For Linux systems, you can also install the Azure CLI by building it from the [source](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=253472&clcid=0x409). For more information on building from source, see the INSTALL file included in the archive.

Now you are ready! Next you can [connect to your Azure subscription from the Azure CLI](xplat-cli-connect.md) and start using the **azure** commands.

## Using Docker Container 

In a Docker host, run:
```
	docker run -it kmouss/azure-cli
```
