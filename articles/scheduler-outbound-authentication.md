# Scheduler Outbound Authentication

Scheduler jobs may need to call out to services that require authentication. This way, a called service can determine if the Scheduler job can access its resources. Some of these services include other Azure services, Salesforce.com, Facebook, and secure custom websites.

## Adding and Removing Authentication

Adding authentication to a Scheduler job is simple – add a JSON child element `authentication` to the `request` element when creating or updating a job. Secrets passed to the Scheduler service in a PUT, PATCH, or POST request – as part of the `authentication` object – are never returned in responses. In responses, secret information is set to null or may have a public token that represents the authenticated entity.

To remove authentication, PUT or PATCH the job explicitly, setting the `authentication` object to null. You will not see any authentication properties back in response.

Currently, the only supported authentication types are the `ClientCertificate` model (for using the SSL/TLS client certificates), the `Basic` model (for Basic authentication), and the `ActiveDirectoryOAuth` model (for Active Directory OAuth authentication.)

## Request Body for ClientCertificate Authentication

When adding authentication using the `ClientCertificate` model, specify the following additional elements in the request body.  

|Element|Description|
|:---|:---|
|_authentication (parent element)_|Authentication object for using an SSL client certificate.|
|_type_|Required. Type of authentication.For SSL client certificates, the value must be `ClientCertificate`.|
|_pfx_|Required. Base64-encoded contents of the PFX file.|
|_password_|Required. Password to access the PFX file.|


## Response Body for ClientCertificate Authentication

When a request is sent with authentication info, the response contains the following authentication-related elements.

|Element |Description |
|:--|:--|
|_authentication (parent element)_ |Authentication object for using an SSL client certificate.|
|_type_ |Type of authentication. For SSL client certificates, the value is `ClientCertificate`.|
|_certificateThumbprint_ |The thumbprint of the certificate.|
|_certificateSubjectName_ |The subject distinguished name of the certificate.|
|_certificateExpiration_ |The expiration date of the certificate.|

## Sample Request and Response for ClientCertificate Authentication

The following example request makes a PUT request that incorporates `ClientCertificate` authentication. The request is as follows:
