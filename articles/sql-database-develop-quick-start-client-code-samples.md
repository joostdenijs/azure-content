# Client development and quick start code samples to SQL Database


This topic provides links to quick start code samples you can use to connect to Azure SQL Database. The samples cover:


- A variety of programming languages.
- Both Windows and Linux as the operating system that your client program will run on.
- Short quick start code samples, plus longer samples that handle transient errors with automated retry logic.
- Code samples that convert relational result sets into an object  oriented format.


> [AZURE.NOTE] As of April 20 2015, code samples for more languages are being prepared, and links to them will be added to this topic.
