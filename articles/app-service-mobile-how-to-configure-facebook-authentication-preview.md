# How to configure your application to use Facebook login

This topic shows you how to configure Azure App Services to use Facebook as an authentication provider.

To complete the procedure in this topic, you must have a Facebook account that has a verified email address and a mobile phone number. To create a new Facebook account, go to [facebook.com].

## <a name="register"> </a>Register your application with Facebook

1. Navigate to the [Facebook Developers] website and sign-in with your Facebook account credentials.

2. (Optional) If you have not already registered, click **Apps** then click **Register as a Developer**, accept the policy and follow the registration steps.

3. Click **Apps**, then click **Create a New App**.

4. Select **Website** as your platform. Choose a unique name for your app, and then click **Create New Facebook App ID**.

5. Pick a category for your application from the dropdown. Then click **Create App ID**.

6. On the next page, select **Skip Quick Start** in the top right. This will take you to the developer dashboard for your application.

7. On the **App Secret** field, click **Show**, provide your password if requested, then make a note of the values of **App ID** and **App Secret**.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] **Security Note**
	The app secret is an important security credential. Do not share this secret with anyone or distribute it within a client application.

8. On the left navigation bar, click **Settings**. Type the URL of the gateway in **App Domains**, and enter a **Contact Email**.

9. If you don't see a website section below, click **Add Platform** and select **Website**. Type the URL of your App Service gateway in **Site URL**, then click **Save Changes**.

10. Click the **Advanced** tab and add your redirect URI to **Valid OAuth redirect URIs**. Then click **Save Changes**. Your redirect URI is the URL of your gateway appended with the path, _/signin-facebook_. For example, `https://contosogateway.azurewebsites.net/signin-facebook`. Make sure that you are using the HTTPS scheme.

11. The Facebook account which was used to register the application is an administrator of the app. At this point, only administrators can sign into this application. To authenticate other Facebook accounts, click **Status & Review** in the left navigation bard. Then click **Yes** to enable general public access.

You are now ready to use Facebook for authentication in your app.
