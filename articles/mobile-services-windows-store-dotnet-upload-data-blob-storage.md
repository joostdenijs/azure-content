# Upload images to Azure Storage by using Mobile Services

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-upload-data-blob-storage](../includes/mobile-services-selector-upload-data-blob-storage.md)]

This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Services to enable your app to upload and store user-generated images in Azure Storage. Mobile Services uses a SQL Database to store data. However, binary large object (BLOB) data is more efficiently stored in Azure Blob storage service. 

You cannot securely distribute with the client app the credentials required to securely upload data to the Blob Storage service. Instead, you must store these credentials in your mobile service and use them to generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) that is used to upload a new image. The SAS, a credential with a short expiration--in this case 5 minutes, is returned securely by Mobile Services to the client app. The app then uses this temporary credential to upload the image. In this example, downloads from the Blob service are public.

In this tutorial you add functionality to the Mobile Services quickstart app to take pictures and upload the images to Azure by using an SAS generated by Mobile Services. This tutorial walks you through the following basic steps to update the Mobile Services quickstart to upload images to the Blob Storage service:

1. [Install the Storage Client library]
2. [Update the insert script to generate an SAS]
3. [Update the client app to capture images]
4. [Upload images to test the app]

This tutorial requires the following:

+ Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8, or a later version
+ [Azure Storage account][How To Create a Storage Account]
+ A camera or other image capture device attached to your computer.

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

##<a name="install-storage-client"></a>Install the Storage client for Windows Store apps

To be able to use an SAS to upload images to Blob storage, you must first add the NuGet package that installs Storage client library for Windows Store apps.

1. In **Solution Explorer** in Visual Studio, right-click the project name, and then select **Manage NuGet Packages**.

2. In the left pane, select the **Online** category, search for `WindowsAzure.Storage`, click **Install** on the **Azure Storage** package, then accept the license agreements.

  	This adds the client library for Azure storage services to the project.

Next, you will update the quickstart app to capture and upload images.
