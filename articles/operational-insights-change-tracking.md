# Identify differences with Change Tracking

[AZURE.INCLUDE [operational-insights-note-moms](../includes/operational-insights-note-moms.md)]

You can use the Configuration Change Tracking solution in Microsoft Azure Operational Insights to help you easily identify software and Windows Services changes that occur in your environment â€” identifying these configuration changes can help you pinpoint operational issues.

You install the solution to update the Operations Manager agent and base configuration module for Operational Insights. Changes to installed software and Windows services on the monitored servers are read and then the data is sent to the Operational Insights service in the cloud for processing. Logic is applied to the received data and the cloud service records the data. When changes are found, servers with changes are shown in the Change Tracking dashboard. By using the information on the Change Tracking dashboard, you can easily see the changes that were made in your server infrastructure.

## Use Change Tracking

Before you can use Change Tracking in Operational Insights, you must have the solution installed. To read more about installing solution, see [Use the Solution Gallery to add or remove solutions](operational-insights-add-solution.md).

After it is installed, you can view the summary of changes for your monitored servers by using the **Change Tracking** tile on the **Overview** page in Operational Insights.
