#Create Advanced Encoding Workflows with Workflow Designer

##Overview
The **Workflow Designer** is a standalone tool that is used to create workflows/graphs for encoding with **Media Encoder Premium Workflow**.

This tool can also be used to modify [existing workflows](media-services-workflow-designer.md#existing_workflows). 

>[AZURE.NOTE]To get a copy of the Workflow Designer tool, please contact mepd@microsoft.com.


Once a workflow file is created, it can be uploaded as an Asset, and then be used for encoding media files. For information on how to encode with **Media Encoder Premium Workflow** using **.NET**, see [Advanced encoding with Media Encoder Premium Workflow](media-services-encode-with-premium-workflow.md).

The default workflow files can be modified using the designer tool. You can get the default workflow files [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-media-services-samples/tree/master/Encoding%20Presets/VoD/MediaEncoderPremiumWorkfows). The folder also contains the description of these files.
