# How to Use Service Bus Topics/Subscriptions

This guide describes how to use Service Bus topics and
subscriptions. The samples are written in C\# and use the .NET API. The
scenarios covered include **creating topics and subscriptions**, **creating
subscription filters**, **sending messages to a topic**, **receiving
messages from a subscription**, and **deleting topics and
subscriptions**. For more information about topics and subscriptions, see
the "Next Steps" section.

## Configure the application to use Service Bus

When you create an application that uses Service Bus, you must add a reference to the Service Bus assembly and include the corresponding namespaces.

## Get the Service Bus NuGet package

The Service Bus **NuGet** package is the easiest way to get the
Service Bus API and to configure your application with all of the
Service Bus dependencies. The NuGet Visual Studio extension makes it
easy to install and update libraries and tools in Visual Studio and
Visual Studio Express. The Service Bus NuGet package is the easiest way
to get the Service Bus API and to configure your application with all of
the Service Bus dependencies.

To install the NuGet package in your application, do the following:

1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click **References**, then click
    **Manage NuGet Packages**.
2.  Search for "Service Bus" and select the **Microsoft Azure
    Service Bus** item. Click **Install** to complete the installation,
    then close this dialog.

You are now ready to write code for Service Bus.

## How to set up a Service Bus connection string

Service Bus uses a connection string to store endpoints and credentials. You can put your connection string in a configuration file, rather than hard-coding it in code:

- When using Azure Cloud Services, it is recommended that you store your connection string using the Azure service configuration system (***.csdef** and ***.cscfg** files).
- When using Azure Websites or Azure Virtual Machines, it is recommended that you store your connection string using the .NET configuration system (for example, the **Web.config** file).

In both cases, you can retrieve your connection string using the `CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting` method, as shown later in this guide.

### Configuring your connection string when using Cloud Services

The service configuration mechanism is unique to Azure Cloud Services
projects and enables you to dynamically change configuration settings
from the Azure management portal without redeploying your
application. For example, add a `Setting` label to your service definition (***.csdef**) file, as shown here:

    <ServiceDefinition name="Azure1">
    ...
        <WebRole name="MyRole" vmsize="Small">
            <ConfigurationSettings>
                <Setting name="Microsoft.ServiceBus.ConnectionString" />
            </ConfigurationSettings>
        </WebRole>
    ...
    </ServiceDefinition>

You then specify values in the service configuration (***.cscfg**) file:

    <ServiceConfiguration serviceName="Azure1">
    ...
        <Role name="MyRole">
            <ConfigurationSettings>
                <Setting name="Microsoft.ServiceBus.ConnectionString" 
                         value="Endpoint=sb://yourServiceNamespace.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=yourKey" />
            </ConfigurationSettings>
        </Role>
    ...
    </ServiceConfiguration>

Use the Shared Access Signature (SAS) key name and key values retrieved from the management portal as
described in the previous section.

### Configuring your connection string when using Websites or Virtual Machines

When using Websites or Virtual Machines, it is recommended you use the .NET configuration system (for example, **Web.config**). You store the connection string using the `<appSettings>` element:

    <configuration>
        <appSettings>
            <add key="Microsoft.ServiceBus.ConnectionString"
                 value="Endpoint=sb://yourServiceNamespace.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=yourKey" />
        </appSettings>
    </configuration>

Use the SAS name and key values that you retrieved from the management portal, as described in the previous section.

## How to create a topic

You can perform management operations for Service Bus topics and subscriptions using the [`NamespaceManager` class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.namespacemanager.aspx) class. This class provides methods to create, enumerate, and delete topics. 

This example constructs a `NamespaceManager` object using the Azure `CloudConfigurationManager` class
with a connection string consisting of the base address of a Service Bus service namespace and the appropriate
SAS credentials with permissions to manage it. This connection string is of the form

    Endpoint=sb://<yourServiceNamespace>.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=yourKey

For example, given the configuration settings in the previous section:

    // Create the topic if it does not exist already
    string connectionString = 
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("Microsoft.ServiceBus.ConnectionString");

    var namespaceManager = 
        NamespaceManager.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);

    if (!namespaceManager.TopicExists("TestTopic"))
    {
        namespaceManager.CreateTopic("TestTopic");
    }

There are overloads of the [`CreateTopic`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.namespacemanager.createtopic.aspx) method that enable you to tune properties
of the topic, for example, to set the default "time-to-live" value
to be applied to messages sent to the topic. These settings are applied
by using the [`TopicDescription`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.topicdescription.aspx) class. The following example shows how
to create a topic named "TestTopic" with a maximum size of 5 GB and a
default message time-to-live of 1 minute.

    // Configure Topic Settings
    TopicDescription td = new TopicDescription("TestTopic");
    td.MaxSizeInMegabytes = 5120;
    td.DefaultMessageTimeToLive = new TimeSpan(0, 1, 0);

    // Create a new Topic with custom settings
    string connectionString = 
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("Microsoft.ServiceBus.ConnectionString");

    var namespaceManager = 
        NamespaceManager.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);

    if (!namespaceManager.TopicExists("TestTopic"))
    {
        namespaceManager.CreateTopic(td);
    }

> [AZURE.NOTE] You can use the [`TopicExists`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.namespacemanager.topicexists.aspx) method on [`NamespaceManager`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.namespacemanager.aspx) objects to check if a topic with a specified name already exists within a service namespace.

## How to create subscriptions

You can also create topic subscriptions using the [`NamespaceManager`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.namespacemanager.aspx)
class. Subscriptions are named and can have an optional filter that
restricts the set of messages passed to the subscription's virtual
queue.

### Create a subscription with the default (MatchAll) filter

The **MatchAll** filter is the default filter that is used if no filter
is specified when a new subscription is created. When you use the **MatchAll**
filter, all messages published to the topic are placed in the
subscription's virtual queue. The following example creates a
subscription named "AllMessages" and uses the default **MatchAll**
filter.

    string connectionString = 
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("Microsoft.ServiceBus.ConnectionString");

    var namespaceManager = 
        NamespaceManager.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);

    if (!namespaceManager.SubscriptionExists("TestTopic", "AllMessages"))
    {
        namespaceManager.CreateSubscription("TestTopic", "AllMessages");
    }

### Create subscriptions with filters

You can also set up filters that enable you to specify which messages sent
to a topic should appear within a specific topic subscription.

The most flexible type of filter supported by subscriptions is the
[SqlFilter] class, which implements a subset of SQL92. SQL filters operate
on the properties of the messages that are published to the topic. For
more information about the expressions that can be used with a SQL filter,
see the [SqlFilter.SqlExpression][] syntax.

The following example creates a subscription named "HighMessages" with a
[SqlFilter] that only selects messages that have a custom
**MessageNumber** property greater than 3:

     // Create a "HighMessages" filtered subscription
     SqlFilter highMessagesFilter = 
        new SqlFilter("MessageNumber > 3");

     namespaceManager.CreateSubscription("TestTopic", 
        "HighMessages", 
        highMessagesFilter);

Similarly, the following example creates a subscription named
"LowMessages" with a [SqlFilter] that only selects messages that have
a **MessageNumber** property less than or equal to 3:

     // Create a "LowMessages" filtered subscription
     SqlFilter lowMessagesFilter = 
        new SqlFilter("MessageNumber <= 3");

     namespaceManager.CreateSubscription("TestTopic", 
        "LowMessages", 
        lowMessagesFilter);

Now when a message is sent to "TestTopic," it is always delivered to receivers subscribed to the "AllMessages" topic subscription, and selectively delivered to receivers subscribed to the "HighMessages" and "LowMessages" topic subscriptions (depending on the message content).

## How to send messages to a topic

To send a message to a Service Bus topic, your application creates a
[`TopicClient`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.topicclient.aspx) object using the connection string.

The code below demonstrates how to create a [`TopicClient`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.topicclient.aspx) object
for the "TestTopic" topic created above using the [`CreateFromConnectionString`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.topicclient.createfromconnectionstring.aspx) API call:

    string connectionString = 
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("Microsoft.ServiceBus.ConnectionString");

    TopicClient Client = 
        TopicClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString, "TestTopic");

    Client.Send(new BrokeredMessage());
 

Messages sent to Service Bus topics are instances of the
[`BrokeredMessage`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.aspx) class. **BrokeredMessage** objects have a set of
standard properties (such as [`Label`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.label.aspx) and [`TimeToLive`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.timetolive.aspx)), a dictionary
that is used to hold custom application-specific properties, and a body
of arbitrary application data. An application can set the body of the
message by passing any serializable object to the constructor of the
[`BrokeredMessage`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.aspx) object, and the appropriate **DataContractSerializer** will
then be used to serialize the object. Alternatively, a
**System.IO.Stream** can be provided.

The following example demonstrates how to send five test messages to the
"TestTopic" [`TopicClient`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.topicclient.aspx) object obtained in the previous code snippet.
Note that the [`MessageNumber`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.properties.aspx) property value of each message varies on
the iteration of the loop (this determines which subscriptions receive it):

     for (int i=0; i<5; i++)
     {
       // Create message, passing a string message for the body
       BrokeredMessage message = 
        new BrokeredMessage("Test message " + i);

       // Set additional custom app-specific property
       message.Properties["MessageNumber"] = i;

       // Send message to the topic
       Client.Send(message);
     }

Service Bus topics support a maximum message size of 256 Kb (the header,
which includes the standard and custom application properties, can have
a maximum size of 64 Kb). There is no limit on the number of messages
held in a topic but there is a cap on the total size of the messages
held by a topic. This topic size is defined at creation time, with an
upper limit of 5 GB. If partitioning is enabled, the upper limit is higher. For more information, see [Partitioning Messaging Entities](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn520246.aspx).

## How to receive messages from a subscription

The recommended way to receive messages from a subscription is to use a
[`SubscriptionClient`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.subscriptionclient.aspx) object. **SubscriptionClient** objects can work in two
different modes: [`ReceiveAndDelete` and `PeekLock`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.receivemode.aspx).

When using the **ReceiveAndDelete** mode, receive is a single-shot
operation - that is, when Service Bus receives a read request for a
message in a subscription, it marks the message as being consumed and
returns it to the application. **ReceiveAndDelete** mode is the simplest
model and works best for scenarios in which an application can tolerate
not processing a message in the event of a failure. To understand this,
consider a scenario in which the consumer issues the receive request and
then crashes before processing it. Because Service Bus will have marked
the message as consumed, when the application restarts and
begins consuming messages again, it will have missed the message that
was consumed prior to the crash.

In **PeekLock** mode (which is the default mode), the receive process becomes a two-stage operation which makes it possible to support applications that
cannot tolerate missing messages. When Service Bus receives a request,
it finds the next message to be consumed, locks it to prevent other
consumers receiving it, and then returns it to the application. After
the application finishes processing the message (or stores it reliably
for future processing), it completes the second stage of the receive
process by calling [`Complete`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.complete.aspx) on the received message. When Service
Bus sees the `Complete` call, it marks the message as being
consumed and removes it from the subscription.

The following example demonstrates how messages can be received and processed 
using the default **PeekLock** mode. To specify a different [`ReceiveMode`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.receivemode.aspx) 
value, you can use another overload for [`CreateFromConnectionString`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.subscriptionclient.createfromconnectionstring.aspx). This 
example uses the [`OnMessage`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.subscriptionclient.onmessage.aspx) callback to process messages as they arrive 
in the "HighMessages" subscription.

    string connectionString = 
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("Microsoft.ServiceBus.ConnectionString");

    SubscriptionClient Client = 
        SubscriptionClient.CreateFromConnectionString
                (connectionString, "TestTopic", "HighMessages");

    // Configure the callback options
    OnMessageOptions options = new OnMessageOptions();
    options.AutoComplete = false;
    options.AutoRenewTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1);

    subscriptionClientHigh.OnMessage((message) =>
    {
        try
        {
            // Process message from subscription
            Console.WriteLine("\n**High Messages**");
            Console.WriteLine("Body: " + message.GetBody<string>());
            Console.WriteLine("MessageID: " + message.MessageId);
            Console.WriteLine("Message Number: " +
                message.Properties["MessageNumber"]);

            // Remove message from subscription
            message.Complete();
        }
        catch (Exception)
        {
            // Indicates a problem, unlock message in subscription
            message.Abandon();
        }
    }, options);

This example configures the [`OnMessage`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.subscriptionclient.onmessage.aspx) callback using an 
[`OnMessageOptions`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.onmessageoptions.aspx) object. [`AutoComplete`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.onmessageoptions.autocomplete.aspx) is set to **false** to enable 
manual control of when to call [`Complete`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.complete.aspx) on the received message.
[`AutoRenewTimeout`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.onmessageoptions.autorenewtimeout.aspx) is set to 1 minute, which causes the client to wait for up to one minute for a message before the call times out and the client makes a new 
call to check for messages. This property value reduces the number of times the client makes 
chargeable calls that do not retrieve messages.

## How to handle application crashes and unreadable messages

Service Bus provides functionality to help you gracefully recover from
errors in your application or difficulties processing a message. If a
receiving application is unable to process the message for some reason,
then it can call the [`Abandon`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.abandon.aspx) method on the received message (instead
of the [`Complete`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.complete.aspx) method). This causes Service Bus to unlock the
message within the subscription and make it available to be received
again, either by the same consuming application or by another consuming
application.

There is also a timeout associated with a message locked within the
subscription, and if the application fails to process the message before
the lock timeout expires (for example, if the application crashes), then Service Bus unlocks the message automatically and makes it available to be received again.

In the event that the application crashes after processing the message
but before the [`Complete`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.complete.aspx) request is issued, the message will be
redelivered to the application when it restarts. This is often called
**At Least Once Processing**; that is, each message is processed at
least once but in certain situations the same message may be
redelivered. If the scenario cannot tolerate duplicate processing, then
application developers should add additional logic to their application
to handle duplicate message delivery. This is often achieved using the
[`MessageId`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.messageid.aspx) property of the message, which will remain constant across
delivery attempts.

## How to delete topics and subscriptions

The example below demonstrates how to delete the topic **TestTopic** from the **HowToSample** service namespace:

     // Delete Topic
     namespaceManager.DeleteTopic("TestTopic");

Deleting a topic will also delete any subscriptions that are registered
with the topic. Subscriptions can also be deleted independently. The
following code demonstrates how to delete a subscription named
**HighMessages** from the **TestTopic** topic:

      namespaceManager.DeleteSubscription("TestTopic", "HighMessages");
