# Machine Learning Apps in the Azure Marketplace

Azure Machine Learning provides data scientists with a channel to monetize their know-how and creativity just as smartphone app developers do. By publishing your machine learning services in the Azure Marketplace, you enable anyone in the world to pay and subscribe to your published cloud APIs and use them in their apps.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [machine-learning-free-trial](../includes/machine-learning-free-trial.md)] 

But Azure Marketplace can offer much more than basic analytics APIs. For example, we built a set of finished end-to-end Machine Learning applications to solve specific business needs. These Machine Learning apps do not require a data scientist or Machine Learning expertise to use them. The science is already baked into our solutions. Users can simply supply their own data and start using the apps. 

For example, these apps include :

##Recommendations##
 A self-service, but super powerful, recommendation engine that enables you to easily add personalized product recommendations to your website or email campaigns.

##Frequently Bought Together##
An API that helps your customers discover items in your catalog that are frequently purchased together. Use your customer purchase history to add Frequently Bought Together recommendations to your website and to improve conversion in your digital store.

##Anomaly Detection##
An API that can spot anomalous events in time series data (for example, server telemetry or sensor-based data).

These APIs allow you to consume powerful machine learning-based services built on Azure Machine Learning, without needing to be a data scientist or spend a lot of time developing apps yourself. Simply bring your own data and start using them.

##Text Analytics##
This API can be used to analyze unstructured text for tasks such as sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction. No training data is needed to use this API, just bring your text data. It uses advanced natural language processing techniques under the hood.
