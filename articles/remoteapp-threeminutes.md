# Try RemoteApp on your device in 3 minutes or less

Want to see RemoteApp on your device? You can access our demo deployment for 10 minutes, as long as you have a Microsoft account. We have Office and a few other applications available. This is a great way to test drive the user experience for RemoteApp in less than 3 minutes.

Interested?

1. Go to to [http://remoteapp.azure.com](http://remoteapp.azure.com).
2. Click **Install Client** in the upper right corner.  
3. The system automatically detects your device and will take you to the client for your device. Install the client.
4. Go back [http://remoteapp.azure.com](http://remoteapp.azure.com) and  sign in with your Microsoft account.
 
You can now access applications running in real time on RemoteApp. 

Your opinion matters. At the end of each session, you will see a dialog box for your feedback. If you have a minute, tell us your thoughts and let us know whether you would like Microsoft to contact you for additional information.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Because this is a controlled environment for demo use, we have not enabled external internet access from the published demo applications. Because of this, services like OneDrive are not accessible. Also, clipboard sharing (Copy & Paste) and USB and printer redirection are disabled.
