# Update servers with System Updates

[AZURE.INCLUDE [operational-insights-note-moms](../includes/operational-insights-note-moms.md)]

You can use the System Updates solution in Microsoft Azure Operational Insights to help you apply missing updates to servers in your infrastructure. You install the solution to update the Operations Manager agent and base configuration module for Operational Insights. Update information is read on the monitored servers and then update data is sent to the Operational Insights service in the cloud for processing. Logic is applied to the update data and the cloud service records the data. If missing updates are found, they are shown on the **Updates** dashboard. You can use the **Updates** dashboard to work with missing updates and develop a plan to apply them to the servers that need them.

## Use System Updates to update servers
