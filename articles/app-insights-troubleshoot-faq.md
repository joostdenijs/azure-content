# Troubleshooting and Questions - Application Insights for ASP.NET

## Can I use Application Insights with ...?

[See Platforms][platforms]

## Adding the SDK

#### <a name="q01"></a>I don't see any option to Add Application Insights to my project in Visual Studio

+ Make sure you have [Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 or later](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=397827). It comes pre-installed with Application Insights Tools.
+ Although the Tools don't support all types of application, you can probably still add an Application Insights SDK to your project manually. Use [this procedure][windows]. 


#### <a name="q02"></a>My new web project was created, but adding Application Insights failed.

This can happen if communication with the Application Insights portal failed, or if there is some problem with your account.

+ Check that you provided login credentials for the right Azure account. The Microsoft Azure credentials, which you see in the New Project dialog, can be different from the Visual Studio Online credentials that you see at the top right of Visual Studio.
+ Wait a while and then [add Application Insights to your existing project][start].
+ Go to your Microsoft Azure account settings and check for restrictions. See if you can manually add an Application Insights application.

#### <a name="emptykey"></a>I get an error "Instrumentation key cannot be empty"

Looks like something went wrong while you were installing Application Insights or maybe a logging adapter.

In Solution Explorer, right-click `ApplicationInsights.config` and choose **Update Application Insights**. You'll get a dialog that invites you to sign in to Azure and either create an Application Insights resource, or re-use an existing one.


#### <a name="q14"></a>What does Application Insights modify in my project?

The details depend on the type of project. For a web application:


+ Adds these files to your project:

 + ApplicationInsights.config. 
 + ai.js


+ Installs these NuGet packages:

 -  *Application Insights API* - the core API

 -  *Application Insights API for Web Applications* - used to send telemetry from the server

 -  *Application Insights API for JavaScript Applications* - used to send telemetry from the client

    The packages include these assemblies:

 - Microsoft.ApplicationInsights

 - Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Platform

+ Inserts items into:

 - Web.config

 - packages.config

+ (New projects only - if you [add Application Insights to an existing project][start], you have to do this manually.) Inserts snippets into the client and server code to initialize them with the Application Insights resource ID. For example, in an MVC app, code is inserted into the master page Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml

####<a name="NuGetBuild"></a> I get "NuGet package(s) are missing" on my build server, though everything builds OK on my dev machines

Please see [NuGet Package Restore](http://docs.nuget.org/Consume/Package-Restore)
and [Automatic Package Restore](http://docs.nuget.org/Consume/package-restore/migrating-to-automatic-package-restore).

## No data

#### <a name="q03"></a>I added Application Insights successfully and ran my app, but I've never seen data in the portal.

+ On the Overview page, click the Search tile to open Diagnostic Search. Data appears here first.
+ Click the Refresh button. In the current version, the content of a blade doesn't refresh automatically.
+ In the Microsoft Azure start board, look at the service status map. If there are some alert indications, wait until they have returned to OK and then close and re-open your Application Insights application blade.
+ Check also [our status blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/applicationinsights-status/archive/2015/04/14/data-latency-and-data-access-issue-with-data-storage-service-4-14-investigating.aspx).
+ In your firewall, you might have to open TCP ports 80 and 443 for outgoing traffic to dc.services.visualstudio.com and f5.services.visualstudio.com.

#### <a name="q04"></a>I see no data under Usage Analytics for my web site

+ The data comes from scripts in the web pages. If you added Application Insights to an existing web project, [you have to add the scripts by hand][start].
+ Make sure Internet Explorer isn't displaying your site in Compatibility mode.
+ Use the browser's debug feature (F12 on some browsers, then choose Network) to verify that data is being sent to dc.services.visualstudio.com.

#### <a name="q08"></a>Can I use Application Insights to monitor an intranet web server?

Yes, you can monitor health and usage if your server can send data to the public internet.

But if you want to run web tests for your service, it must be accessible from the public internet on port 80.

#### I used to see data, but it has stopped

* Check the [status blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/applicationinsights-status/)


## The Portal

#### <a name="q05"></a>I'm looking at the Microsoft Azure Preview start board. How do I find my data in Application Insights?

Either:

* Choose Browse, Application Insights, your project name. If you don't have any projects there, you need to [add Application Insights to your web project in Visual Studio][start].

* In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click your web project and choose Open Application Insights Portal.


#### <a name="update"></a>How can I change which Azure resource my project sends data to?

In Solution Explorer, right-click `ApplicationInsights.config` and choose **Update Application Insights**. You can send the data to an existing or new resource in Azure. The update wizard changes the instrumentation key in ApplicationInsights.config, which determines where the server SDK sends your data. Unless you deselect "Update all," it will also change the key where it appears in your web pages.


#### <a name="q06"></a>On the Microsoft Azure Preview home screen, does that map show the status of my application?

No! It shows the status of the Azure service. To see your web test results, choose Browse > Application Insights > (your application) and then look at the web test results. 


#### <a name="q07"></a>When I use add Application Insights to my application and open the Application Insights portal, it all looks completely different from your screenshots.

You might be using [the older version of the Application Insights SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn793604.aspx), which connects to the Visual Studio Online version.

The help pages you're looking at refer to [Application Insights for Microsoft Azure Preview][start], which comes already switched on in Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 and later. 

#### <a name="data"></a>How long is data retained in the portal? Is it secure?

Take a look at [Data Retention and Privacy][data].

## Logging

#### <a name="post"></a>How do I see POST data in Diagnostic search?

We don't log POST data automatically, but you can use a TrackTrace call: put the data in the message parameter. This has a longer size limit than the limits on string properties, though you can't filter on it. 

## Security

#### Is my data secure in the portal? How long is it retained?

See [Data Retention and Privacy][data].
