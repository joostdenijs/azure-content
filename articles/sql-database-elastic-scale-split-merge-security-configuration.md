# Split-Merge security configuration  

To use the Split/Merge service, you must correctly configure security. The service is part of the Elastic Scale feature of Microsoft Azure SQL Database. For more information, see [Elastic Scale Split and Merge Service Tutorial](sql-database-elastic-scale-configure-deploy-split-and-merge.md)

## Configuring certificates

Certificates are configured in two ways. 

1. [To Configure the SSL Certificate][]
2. [To Configure Client Certificates][] 

## To obtain certificates

Certificates can be obtained from public Certificate Authorities (CAs) or from the [Windows Certificate Service](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa376539.aspx). These are the preferred methods to obtain certificates.

If those options are not available, you can generate **self-signed certificates**.
 
## Tools to generate certificates

* [makecert.exe](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bfsktky3.aspx)
* [pvk2pfx.exe](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550672.aspx)

### To run the tools

* From a Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studios, see [Visual Studio Command Prompt](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms229859.aspx) 

    If installed, go to:

        %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Windows Kits\x.y\bin\x86 

* Get the WDK from [Windows 8.1: Download kits and tools](http://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/gg454513#drivers)

## <a name="allowed-ip-addresses"></a>Allowed IP addresses

Access to the service endpoints can be restricted to specific ranges of IP addresses.

## To configure encryption for the store

A certificate is required to encrypt the credentials that are stored in the metadata store. Choose the most applicable of the three scenarios below, and execute all its steps:

### Use a new self-signed certificate

1.     [Create a Self-Signed Certificate][]
2.     [Create PFX file for Self-Signed Encryption Certificate][]
3.     [Upload Encryption Certificate to Cloud Service][]
4.     [Update Encryption Certificate in Service Configuration File][]

### Use an existing certificate from the certificate store

3.     [Update Encryption Certificate in Service Configuration File][]

### Use an existing certificate in a PFX file

1.     [Upload Encryption Certificate to Cloud Service][]
2.     [Update Encryption Certificate in Service Configuration File][]

## The default configuration

The default configuration denies all access to the HTTP endpoint. This is the recommended setting, since the requests to these endpoints may carry sensitive information like database credentials.
The default configuration allows all access to the HTTPS endpoint. This setting may be restricted further.

### Changing the Configuration

The group of access control rules that apply to and endpoint are configured in the **<EndpointAcls>** section in the **service configuration file**.

    <EndpointAcls>
      <EndpointAcl role="SplitMergeWeb" endPoint="HttpIn" accessControl="DenyAll" />
      <EndpointAcl role="SplitMergeWeb" endPoint="HttpsIn" accessControl="AllowAll" />
    </EndpointAcls>

The rules in an access control group are configured in a <AccessControl name=""> section of the service configuration file. 

The format is explained in Network Access Control Lists documentation.
For example, to allow only IPs in the range 100.100.0.0 to 100.100.255.255 to access the HTTPS endpoint, the rules would look like this:

    <AccessControl name="Retricted">
      <Rule action="permit" description="Some" order="1" remoteSubnet="100.100.0.0/16"/>
      <Rule action="deny" description="None" order="2" remoteSubnet="0.0.0.0/0" />
    </AccessControl>
    <EndpointAcls>
    <EndpointAcl role="SplitMergeWeb" endPoint="HttpsIn" accessControl="Restricted" />

## <a name = "denial-of-service-prevention"></a>Denial of service prevention

There are two different mechanisms supported to detect and prevent Denial of Service attacks:

*    Restrict number of concurrent requests per remote host (off by default)
*    Restrict rate of access per remote host (on by default)

These are based on the features further documented in Dynamic IP Security in IIS. When changing this configuration beware of the following factors:

* The behavior of proxies and Network Address Translation devices over the remote host information
* Each request to any resource in the web role is considered (e.g. loading scripts, images, etc)

## Restricting number of concurrent accesses

The settings that configure this behavior are:

    <Setting name="DynamicIpRestrictionDenyByConcurrentRequests" value="false" />
    <Setting name="DynamicIpRestrictionMaxConcurrentRequests" value="20" />

Change DynamicIpRestrictionDenyByConcurrentRequests to true to enable this protection.

## Restricting rate of access

The settings that configure this behavior are:

    <Setting name="DynamicIpRestrictionDenyByRequestRate" value="true" />
    <Setting name="DynamicIpRestrictionMaxRequests" value="100" />
    <Setting name="DynamicIpRestrictionRequestIntervalInMilliseconds" value="2000" />

## Configuring the response to a denied request

The following setting configures the response to a denied request:

    <Setting name="DynamicIpRestrictionDenyAction" value="AbortRequest" />
Refer to the documentation for Dynamic IP Security in IIS for other supported values.

## Operations for configuring service certificates
This topic is for reference only. Please follow the configuration steps outlined in:

* Configure the SSL certificate

# <a name="other-security"></a> Other security considerations
 
The SSL settings described in this document encrypt communication between the service and its clients when the HTTPS endpoint is used. This is important since credentials for database access and potentially other sensitive information are contained in the communication. Note, however, that the service persists internal status, including credentials, in its internal tables in the Microsoft Azure SQL database that you have provided for metadata storage in your Microsoft Azure subscription. That database was defined as part of the following setting in your service configuration file (.CSCFG file): 

    <Setting name="ElasticScaleMetadata" value="Server=â€¦" />

Credentials stored in this database are encrypted. However, as a best practice, ensure that both web and worker roles of your service deployments are kept up to date and secure as they both have access to the metadata database and the certificate used for encryption and decryption of stored credentials.
