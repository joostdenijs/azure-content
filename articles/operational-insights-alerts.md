# View Operations Manager alerts

[AZURE.INCLUDE [operational-insights-note-moms](../includes/operational-insights-note-moms.md)]

Before you can use Alert Management in Microsoft Azure Operational Insights, you must have the solution installed. To read more about installing solutions, see [Use the Solutions Gallery to add or remove solutions](operational-insights-add-solution.md). The solution only works when  your servers are monitored by to Operations Manager agents. See [Connect to Operational Insights from System Center Operations Manager](operational-insights-connect-scom.md) for information about using Operations Manager with Operational Insights.

After the solution is installed, you can view alerts for your monitored servers by using the **Alert Management** tile on the **Overview** dashboard in Operational Insights.

You can view and manage Microsoft Azure Operational Insights alerts from the **Alerts** dashboard. On the dashboard, alert information is displayed in the following categories:

- Active Alerts
	- Critical Alerts
	- Warning Alerts
	- Alert Sources
- All Active Alerts
	- Shows the percentage of alerts that are critical, warnings, and informational.
- Common Alert Queries
	- This area contains pre-built queries that the Operational Insights software development team has created to help you get started using alerts.


Alerts tell you that an issue was detected, which server the alert affects, the priority, and the name of the alert.
