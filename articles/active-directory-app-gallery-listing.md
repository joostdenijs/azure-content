# Listing your application in the Azure Active Directory application gallery

To list an application that supports single sign-on with Azure Active Directory in the [Azure AD gallery](http://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/active-directory/all/) and in the Azure Marketplace, the Azure AD team will need to verify your integration. This requires that you send the following information to <waadpartners@microsoft.com>:

- The username and password of a test user account in a test instance of Azure Active Directory that is able to sign into your application
- URL and/or instructions on how this test user should sign into the application
- Provide a brief description of how your customers create the connection between your application and Azure AD. This could be:
  - Built into the application using the Azure AD consent framework
  - By  configuring Azure AD as an identity provider (SAML 2.0, WS-Federation, or OpenID Connect) using an you applicationâ€™s administrative portal
  - By contacting someone in your organization to manually create the connection
- If your application supports configuring Azure AD as an identity provider through a self-service administrative portal, then please also provide a test admin account for verification.

After testing is completed, then the application can be listed in the Azure Active Directory application gallery and in the Azure Marketplace. Complete the questions below and send to <waadpartners@microsoft.com>.
