#Architecture
Resources for building applications that use Microsoft Azure.

##Microsoft Architecture Blueprints

Microsoft publishes a set of high level architecture blueprints showing how to build specific types of systems which include  Mirosoft products and Microsoft Azure services. Each blueprint includes a 2D Visio-based file that you can download and modify, a more colorful 3D PDF file to introduce the blueprint, and a video that walks through the 3D version. See 
[Microsoft Architecture Blueprints](http://msdn.microsoft.com/dn630664). 

The 2D Blueprint diagrams use the Cloud and Enterprise Symbol Set mentioned below.  

The 3D Blueprint PDFs are created in a non-Microsoft tool, but a Visio template is under development. See a [BETA training video of the template here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXDzcb5HNtM). To obtain the Visio 3d Blueprint Template beta, email [CnESymbols@microsoft.com](mailto:CnESymbols@microsoft.com).

##Cloud and Enterprise Symbol/Icon set

[Download the Cloud and Enterprise Symbol/Icon set](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41937) to create technical materials that describe Azure, Windows Server, SQL Server and other Microsoft products. You can use them in architecture diagrams, training materials, presentations, datasheets, infographics, whitepapers and even 3rd party books if the book trains people to use Microsoft products. The symbols are in Visio and PNG formats. Instructions on how to use the PNGs in PowerPoint are included. 

The symbol set ships quarterly and is updated as new services are released. If you want a preview of the newest release, which may include additional Azure services, email [CnESymbols@microsoft.com](mailto:CnESymbols@microsoft.com).  

Weâ€™d like to know what you think, so there are instructions for providing feedback in the download. If you've used the symbols, fill out the short 5 question [survey](http://aka.ms/azuresymbolssurveyv2) or email us at the address above to let us know if they are useful and how you use them.  

Additional symbols are available in the [Microsoft Office Visio stencil](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35772), though they are not optimized for architectural diagrams like the CnE set is.

##Design patterns
Microsoft Patterns and Practices has published the book [Cloud Design Patterns](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn568099.aspx) which is available both on MSDN and in PDF download. There is also a large format poster available which lists all the patterns.

##Architecture Infographics
Microsoft publishes several architecture related posters/infographics. They include [Building Real-World Cloud Applications](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/infographics/building-real-world-cloud-apps/) and [Scaling with Cloud Services](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/infographics/cloud-services/) .
