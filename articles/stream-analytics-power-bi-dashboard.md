#Azure Stream Analytics & Power BI: Live dashboard for real-time analytics of streaming data

One of the common use case for Azure Stream Analytics is to analyze high volume streaming data in real time and get the insight in a live dashboard (a dashboard that updates in real time without user having to refresh the browser).  

[Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.com/) is perfect for building live dashboard in no time. [Here is an example video to illustrate the scenario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGUpT-a99MA). In this article, learn how to use Power BI as an output for your Azure Stream Analytics job. 

> [AZURE.NOTE] Power BI output is a preview feature of Azure Stream Analytics. 

##Prerequisites

* Microsoft Azure Account using Org Id (Power BI works with Org ID only. Org ID is your work or business email address e.g. xyz@mycompany.com. Personal emails like xyz@hotmail.com are not org ids. You can learn more about org id [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/dn531048.aspx) and there is also a FAQ that can be downloaded from [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=331007&clcid=0x409) ).
* An input stream for ASA (Azure Stream Analytics) job to consume streaming data from. At this point, ASA accepts input from an Azure Eventhub or Azure Blob Store.  

##Create Azure Stream Analytics Job

From [Azure Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com), click **New, Data Services, Stream Analytics, Quick Create**.

Specifiy the following values, then click **Create Stream Analytics job**:

* **Job Name** - Enter a job name. For example, **DeviceTemperatures**.
* **Region** - Select the region where you want the job located. Consider placing the job and the event hub in the same region to ensure optimal performance and avoid incurring data transfer costs between regions.
* **Storage Account** - Choose the Storage Account that you would like to use to store monitoring data for all Stream Analytics jobs running within this region. You have the option to choose an existing Storage Account or create a new one.

Click **Stream Analytics** in the left pane to list the Stream Analytics jobs.

![graphic1][graphic1]

> [AZURE.TIP] The new job will be listed with a status of **Not Started**. Notice that the **Start** button on the bottom of the page is disabled. This is expected behavior as you must configure the job input, output, query, and so on before you can start the job.

##Specify job input

For this tutorial, we are assuming you are using EventHub as an input with JSON serialization and utf-8 encoding.

* Click the job name.
* Click **Inputs** from the top of the page, and then click **Add Input**. The dialog that opens will walk you through a number of steps to set up your input.
*	Select **Data Stream**, and then click the right button.
*	Select **Event Hub**, and then click the right button.
*	Type or select the following values on the third page:
  *	**Input Alias** - Enter a friendly name for this job input. Note that you will be using this name in the query later on.
  * **Event Hub** - If the Event Hub you created is in the same subscription as the Stream Analytics job, select the namespace that the event hub is in.
*	If your event hub is in a different subscription, select **Use Event Hub from Another Subscription** and manually enter information for **Service Bus Namespace**, **Event Hub Name**, **Event Hub Policy Name**, **Event Hub Policy Key**, and **Event Hub Partition Count**.

> [AZURE.NOTE]	This sample uses the default number of partitions, which is 16.

* **Event Hub Name** - Select the name of the Azure event hub you have.
* **Event Hub Policy Name** - Select the event-hub policy for the eventhub you are using. Ensure that this policy has manage permissions.
*	**Event Hub Consumer Group** – You can leave this empty or specify a consumer group you have on your event hub. Note that each consumer group of an event hub can have only 5 readers at a time. So, decide the right consumer group for your job accordingly. If you leave the field blank, it will use the default consumer group.

*	Click the right button.
*	Specify the following values:
  *	**Event Serializer Format** - JSON
  *	**Encoding** - UTF8
*	Click the check button to add this source and to verify that Stream Analytics can successfully connect to the event hub.

##Add Power BI output

1.  Click **Output** from the top of the page, and then click **Add Output**. You will see Power BI listed as an output option.

![graphic2][graphic2]

> [AZURE.NOTE] Note - Power BI output is available only for Azure accounts using Org Ids. If you are not using an Org Id for your azure account (e.g. your live id/ personal Microsoft account), you will not see a Power BI output option.

2.  Select **Power BI** and then click the right button.
3.  You will see a screen like the following:

![graphic3][graphic3]

4.  In this step, you have to be careful to use the same Org Id that you are using for your ASA job. At this point, Power BI output has to use the same Org Id that your ASA job uses. If you already have Power BI account using the same Org Id, select “Authorize Now”. If not, choose “Sign up now” and use same Org Id as your azure account while signing up for Power BI. [Here is a good blog walking through details of Power BI sign up](http://blogs.technet.com/b/powerbisupport/archive/2015/02/06/power-bi-sign-up-walkthrough.aspx).
5.  Next you will see a screen like the following:

![graphic4][graphic4]

Provide values as below:

* **Output Alias** – You can put any output alias that is easy for you to refer to. This output alias is particularly helpful if you decide to have multiple outputs for your job. In that case, you have to refer to this output in your query. For example, let’s use the output alias value = “OutPbi”.
* **Dataset Name** - Provide a dataset name that you want your Power BI output to have. For example, let’s use “pbidemo”.
*	**Table Name** - Provide a table name under the dataset of your Power BI output. Let’s say we call it “pbidemo”. Currently, Power BI output from ASA jobs may only have one table in a dataset.

>	[AZURE.NOTE] Note - You should not explicitly create this dataset and table in your Power BI account. They will be automatically created when you start your ASA job and the job starts pumping output into Power BI. If your ASA job query doesn’t return any results, the dataset and table will not be created.

*	Click **OK**, **Test Connection** and now you output configuraiton is complete.

>	[AZURE.WARNING] Also be aware that if Power BI already had a dataset and table with the same name as the one you provided in this ASA job, the existing data will be overwritten.


##Write Query

Go to the **Query** tab of your job. Write your query, the output of which you want in your Power BI. For example, it could be something such as the following SQL query:

    SELECT
    	MAX(hmdt) AS hmdt,
    	MAX(temp) AS temp,
    	System.TimeStamp AS time,
    	dspl
    INTO
        OutPBI
    FROM
    	Input TIMESTAMP BY time
    GROUP BY
    	TUMBLINGWINDOW(ss,1),
    	dspl

    
    
Start your job. Validate that your event hub is receiving events and your query generates the expected results. If your query outputs 0 rows, Power BI dataset and tables will not be automatically created.

##Create the Dashboard in Power BI

Go to [Powerbi.com](https://powerbi.com) and login with your Org Id. If the ASA job query outputs results, you will see your dataset is already created:

![graphic5][graphic5]

For creating the dashboard, go to the Dashboards option and create a new Dashboard.

![graphic6][graphic6]

In this example we'll lable it "Demo Dashboard".

Now click on the dataset created by your ASA job (pbidemo in our current example). You will be taken to a page to create a chart on top of this dataset. The following is but one example of the reports you can create:

Select Σ temp and time fields. They will automatically go to Value and Axis for the chart:

![graphic7][graphic7]

With this, you will automatically get a chart as below:

![graphic8][graphic8]

In the value section, click on the drop down for temp and choose **average** for the temperature and on the chart, click on **visualization** and choose **line chart**:

![graphic9][graphic9]

You will now get a line chart of average over time.  Using the pin option as below, you can pin this to your dashboard that you previously created:

![graphic10][graphic10]

Now when you view the dashboard with this pinned report, you will see report updating in real time. Try changing the data in your events – spike temp or something like that and you will see the real-time effect of that reflected in your dashboard.

Note that this tutorial demonstrated how to create but one kind of chart for a dataset. However, the possibilities with Power BI are unlimited. For another example of a Power BI dashboard, watch the [Getting Started with Power BI](https://youtu.be/L-Z_6P56aas?t=1m58s) video.
