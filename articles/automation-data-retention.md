# Azure Automation data retention

When you delete a resource in Azure Automation, it is retained for 90 days for auditing purposes before being removed permanently.  You can’t see or use the resource during this time.  This policy also applies to resources that belong to an automation account that is deleted.

Azure Automation automatically deletes and permanently removes jobs older than 90 days.

The following table summarizes the retention policy for different resources.

|Data|Policy|
|:---|:---|
|Accounts|Permanently removed 90 days after the account is deleted by a user.|
|Assets|Permanently removed 90 days after the asset is deleted by a user, or 90 days after the account that holds the asset is deleted by a user.|
|Modules|Permanently removed 90 days after the module is deleted by a user, or 90 days after the account that holds the module is deleted by a user.|
|Runbooks|Permanently removed 90 days after the resource is deleted by a user, or 90 days after the account that holds the resource is deleted by a user.|
|Jobs|Deleted and permanently removed 90 days after last being modified. This could be after the job completes, is stopped, or is suspended.|

The retention policy applies to all users and currently cannot be customized.
