### To install agent using setup
1. Run Setup to install the agent on a computer that you want to manage.
2. Select **Connect the agent to Microsoft Azure Operational Insights** and then click **Next**.
3. When prompted, enter the **Workspace ID** and **Primary Key** that you copied into Notepad in the previous procedure.

4. Click **Next**.  The agent verifies that it can connect to Operational Insights.
5. When complete, the **Microsoft Management Agent** appears in **Control Panel**.

### To install agent using the command line
- Modify and then use the following example to install the agent using the command line.
```MMASetup-AMD64.exe /C:"setup.exe /qn ADD_OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE=1 OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_ID=<your workspace id> OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_KEY=<your workspace key> AcceptEndUserLicenseAgreement=1"```

## Configure the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (optional)
Use the following information to enable an agent to communicate directly with the Microsoft Azure Operational Insights service. After you've configured the agent, it will register with the agent service and will get necessary configuration information and management packs that contain solution information.

After data is collected from computers monitored by the agent, the number of computers monitored will appear in the Operational Insights portal in the **Connected Sources** tab in **Settings** under **Attach Servers Directly (64 bit)**. For any computer that sends data, you can view its data and assessment information in the Operational Insights portal.

You can also disable the agent, if needed or you enable it using the command line or script.

### To configure the agent
1. After you've installed the **Microsoft Monitoring Agent**, open **Control Panel**.
2. Open Microsoft Monitoring Agent and then click the Azure Operational Insights tab.
3. Select **Connect to Azure Operational Insights**.
4. In the **Workspace ID** box, paste the Workspace ID from the Operational Insights portal.
5. In the **Account Key** box, paste the **Primary Key** from the Operational Insights portal and then click **OK**.

### To disable an agent
1. After installing the agent, open **Control Panel**.
2. Open Microsoft Monitoring Agent and then click the **Azure Operational Insights** tab.
3. Clear **Connect to Azure Operational Insights**.

### To Enable the agent using the command line or script
- You can use either Windows PowerShell or a VB script with the following example.

```powershell
$healthServiceSettings = New-Object -ComObject 'AgentConfigManager.MgmtSvcCfg'
$healthServiceSettings.EnableOnlineMonitoring('workspacename', 'workspacekey')
$healthServiceSettings.ReloadConfiguration()
```

## Configure proxy and firewall settings (optional)
If you have proxy servers or firewalls in your environment that restrict access to the Internet, you might need to follow the following procedures to enable Operations Manager or agents to communicate to the Operational Insights service.
