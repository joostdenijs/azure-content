# Requirements for RemoteApp images
RemoteApp uses a Windows Server 2012 R2 image to host all the programs that you want to share with your users. To create a custom RemoteApp image, you can start with an existing image or [create a new one](remoteapp-create-custom-image.md). The requirements for the image that can be uploaded for use with Azure RemoteApp are:


- Custom applications donâ€™t store data locally on the image. These images are stateless and should only contain applications.
- The image does not contain data that can be lost.
- The image size should be a multiple of MBs. If you try to upload an image that is not an exact multiple, the upload will fail.
- The image size must be 127 GB or smaller. 
- It must be on a VHD file (VHDX files are not currently supported).
- The VHD must not be a generation 2 virtual machine.
- The VHD can be either fixed-size or dynamically expanding. A dynamically expanding VHD is recommended because it takes less time to upload to Azure than a fixed-size VHD file.
- The disk must be initialized using the Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning style. The GUID partition table (GPT) partition style is not supported. 
- The VHD must contain a single installation of Windows Server 2012 R2. It can contain multiple volumes, but only one that contains an installation of Windows. 
- The Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) role and the Desktop Experience feature must be installed.
- The Remote Desktop Connection Broker role must *not* be installed.
- The Encrypting File System (EFS) must be disabled.
- The image must be SYSPREPed using the parameters **/oobe /generalize /shutdown** (DO NOT use the **/mode:vm** parameter).
- Uploading your VHD from a snapshot chain is not supported.
