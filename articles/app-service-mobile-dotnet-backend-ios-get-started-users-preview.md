# Add authentication to your iOS app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-users](../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-users.md)]

This topic shows you how to authenticate users of an App Service Mobile App from your client application. In this tutorial, you add authentication to the quickstart project using an identity provider that is supported by App Service. After being successfully authenticated and authorized by your Mobile App, the user ID value is displayed.

This tutorial is based on the Mobile App quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Create an iOS app].

##<a name="register"></a>Register your app for authentication and configure App Services

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-register-authentication](../includes/app-service-mobile-register-authentication.md)]

##<a name="permissions"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend](../includes/app-service-mobile-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend.md)]

<ol start="7">
<li><p>In Xcode, open the project. Press the <b>Run</b> button to  start the app. Verify that an exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts.</p>

   	<p>This happens because the app attempts to access your Mobile App Code as an unauthenticated user, but the <em>TodoItem</em> table now requires authentication.</p></li>
</ol>

Next, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from your App Service.

##<a name="add-authentication"></a>Add authentication to the app
