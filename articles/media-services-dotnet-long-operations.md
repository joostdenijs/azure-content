#Delivering Live Streaming with Azure Media Services

##Overview

Microsoft Azure Media Services offers APIs that send requests to Media Services to start operations (for example: create, start, stop, or delete a channel). These operations are long-running.

The Media Services .NET SDK provides APIs that send the request and wait for the operation to complete (internally, the APIs are polling for operation progress at some intervals). For example, when you call channel.Start(), the method returns after the channel is started. You can also use the asynchronous version: await channel.StartAsync() (for information about Task-based Asynchronous Pattern, see [TAP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh873175(v=vs.110).aspx)). APIs that send an operation request and then poll for the status until the operation is complete are called “polling methods”. These methods (especially the Async version) are recommended for rich client applications and/or stateful services.

There are scenarios where an application cannot wait for a long running http request and wants to poll for the operation progress manually. A typical example would be a browser interacting with a stateless web service: when the browser requests to create a channel, the web service initiates a long running operation and returns the operation ID to the browser. The browser could then ask the web service to get the operation status based on the ID. The Media Services .NET SDK provides APIs that are useful for this scenario. These APIs are called “non-polling methods”.
The “non-polling methods” have the following naming pattern: Send*OperationName*Operation (for example, SendCreateOperation). Send*OperationName*Operation methods return the **IOperation** object; the returned object contains information that can be used to track the operation. The Send*OperationName*OperationAsync methods return **Task<IOperation>**.

Currently, the following classes support non-polling methods:  **Channel**, **StreamingEndpoint**, and **Program**.

To poll for the operation status, use the **GetOperation** method on the **OperationBaseCollection** class. Use the following intervals to check the operation status: for **Channel** and **StreamingEndpoint** operations, use 30 seconds; for **Program** operations, use 10 seconds.


##Example

The following example defines a class called **ChannelOperations**. This class definition could be a starting point for your web service class definition. For simplicity, the following examples use the non-async versions of methods.

The example also shows how the client might use this class.

###The client code

	ChannelOperations channelOperations = new ChannelOperations();
	string opId = channelOperations.StartChannelCreation("MyChannel001");
	
	string channelId = null;
	bool isCompleted = false;
	
	while (isCompleted == false)
	{
	    System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));
	    isCompleted = channelOperations.IsCompleted(opId, out channelId);
	}
	
	// If we got here, we should have the newly created channel id.
	Console.WriteLine(channelId);
