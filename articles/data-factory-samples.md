2. In the **DATA FACTORY** blade for the data factory, click the **Sample pipelines** tile.

Contosoâ€™s goal is to collect and analyze the logs produced by these games to get usage information, identify up-sell and cross-sell opportunities, develop new compelling features etc... to improve business and provide better experience to customers. This sample collects sample logs, processes and enriches them with reference data, and transforms the data to evaluate the effectiveness of a marketing campaign that Contoso has recently launched.
 
## Samples on GitHub
The [GitHub Azure-DataFactory repository](https://github.com/azure/azure-datafactory) contains several samples that help you quickly ramp up with Azure Data Factory service (or) modify the scripts and use it in own application. The Samples\JSON folder contains JSON snippets for common scenarios.
