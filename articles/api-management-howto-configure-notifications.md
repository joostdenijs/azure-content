# How to configure notifications and email templates in Azure API Management

API Management provides the ability to configure notifications for specific events, and to configure the email templates that are used to communicate with the administrators and developers of an API Management instance. This topic shows how to configure notifications for the available events, and provides an overview of configuring the email templates used for these events.

To configure notifications, click **Manage** in the Azure Portal for your API Management service. This takes you to the API Management publisher portal.

![Publisher portal][api-management-management-console]

>If you have not yet created an API Management service instance, see [Create an API Management service instance][] in the [Get started with Azure API Management][] tutorial.

Click **Notifications** from the **API Management** menu on the left to view the available notifications.

The following list of events can be configured for notifications.

-	**Subscription requests (requiring approval)** - The specified email recipients and users will receive email notifications about subscription requests for API products requiring approval.
-	**New subscriptions** - The specified email recipients and users will receive email notifications about new API product subscriptions.
-	**Application gallery requests** - The specified email recipients and users will receive email notifications when new applications are submitted to the application gallery.
-	**BCC** - The specified email recipients and users will receive email blind carbon copies of all emails sent to developers.
-	**New issue or comment** - The specified email recipients and users will receive email notifications when a new issue or comment is submitted on the developer portal.
-	**Close account message** - The specified email recipients and users will receive email notifications when an account is closed.
-	**Approaching subscription quota limit** - The following email recipients and users will receive email notifications when subscription usage gets close to usage quota.

For each event, you can specify email recipients using the email address text box or you can select users from a list.

To specify the email addresses to be notified, enter them in the email address text box. If you have multiple email addresses, separate them using commas.

![Notification recipients][api-management-email-addresses]

To specify the users to be notified, click **add recipient**, check the box beside the users to be notified, and click **OK**.

>Note that only administrators are displayed in the list.

After configuring the notification recipients, click **Save** to apply the updated notification recipients.

>If you navigate away from the **Publisher Notifications** tab the API Management portal alerts you if there are unsaved changes.

![Email templates][api-management-email-templates]

To view or modify a specific template, select it from the **Templates** drop-down list.
