4. Start PuTTY. 

5. In the right pane, change the **Connection type** to **Serial**.

6. In the right pane, type the appropriate COM port. Make sure that the serial configuration parameters are set as follows:
  - Speed: 115,200
  - Data bits: 8
  - Stop bits: 1
  - Parity: None
  - Flow control: None

    These settings are shown in the following illustration.

7. Click **Open** to start a serial session.
