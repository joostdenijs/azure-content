The UCI Statlog (German Credit Card) dataset (<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)">Statlog+German+Credit+Data</a>), using the german.data file.<p> </p>The dataset classifies people, described by a set of attributes, as low or high credit risks. Each example represents a person. There are 20 features, both numerical and categorical, and a binary label (the credit risk value). High credit risk entries have label = 2, low credit risk entries have label = 1. The cost of misclassifying a low risk example as high is 1, whereas the cost of misclassifying a high risk example as low is 5.
