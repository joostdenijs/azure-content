At any time after provisioning a MongoLab database, you can access the MongoLab web UI for managing that database. We offer convenient single-sign-on (SSO) access through the Azure Management Portal.

You can use the MongoLab UI to perform most database tasks, such as inserting and querying for documents, obtaining database statistics, and running useful database commands. To learn more about the MongoLab UI, visit our [support page](http://support.mongolab.com) and our [blog](http://blog.mongolab.com).

To access the MongoLab UI, do the following:

1. Select **Add-ons**.  
![AddonsButton][button-addons]
1. Locate your MongoLab service in your list of add-ons.  
![MongolabEntry][entry-mongolabaddon]
1. Cick the name of your add-on to reach the add-on page.
1. Click **Manage**.  
![ManageButton][button-manage]  
A new browser tab opens, displaying the MongoLab database home page:  
![DbHome][screen-dblanding]

From here you can select a specific collection and drill down to individual documents. Log out when you are finished.
