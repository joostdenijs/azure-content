A collection of simulated energy profiles, based on 12 different building shapes. The buildings differ with respect to differentiated by 8 features, such as glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and orientation.<p> </p><b>Usage:</b> Use either regression or classification to predict the energy efficiency rating based as one of two real valued responses. For multi-class classification, is round the response variable to the nearest integer. <p> </p><b>Related Research:</b> Xifara, A. & Tsanas, A. (2012).
