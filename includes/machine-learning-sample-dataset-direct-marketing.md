The dataset contains customer data and indications about their response to a direct mailing campaign. Each row represents a customer. The dataset contains 9 features about user demographics and past behavior, and 3 label columns (visit, conversion, and spend).  Visit is a binary column that indicates that a customer visited after the marketing campaign, conversion indicates a customer purchased something, and spend is the amount that was spent.  The dataset was made available by Kevin Hillstrom for MineThatData E-Mail Analytics And Data Mining Challenge.
