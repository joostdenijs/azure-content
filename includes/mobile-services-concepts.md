## <a name="what-is"></a>What is Mobile Services

Mobile Services is an Azure service offering designed to make it easy to create highly-functional mobile apps using Azure. Mobile Services brings together a set of Azure services that enable backend capabilities for your apps. Mobile Services provides the following facilities in Azure to support your apps: 

+ Simple provisioning and management of tables for storing app data. 
+ Integration with notification services to deliver push notifications to your app.
+ Integration with well-known identity providers for authentication.
+ Granular control for authorizing access to tables.
+ Custom business logic on the server.
+ Integration with other cloud services.
+ Supports the ability to scale a mobile service instance.
+ Service monitoring and logging.

Mobile Services provides a client library for each supported platform, which makes it even easier to develop apps on your platform that consume Mobile Services.

The following are important features and concepts in the Mobile Services:

<!--![1][1]-->

+ **.NET backend:** This kind of mobile service is implemented as a ASP.NET Web API project. Backend code is implemented as WebAPI controllers.
+ **Application key:** A unique value that is generated by Mobile Services, distributed with your app, and presented in client-generated requests. While useful for limiting access to your mobile service from random clients, this key is not secure and should not be used to authenticate users of your app.    
+ **Authentication token:** The acccess token that is generated by Mobile Services after a user is authenticated.
+ **Identity provider:** External service, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft Account, or Azure Active Directory, that is used to authenticate users of your mobile service.
+ **JavaScript backend:** This kind of mobile service is implemented as a node.js service. Backend code is written as JavaScript.
+ **Permission:** The minimum authentication level needed to invoke a table operation or custom API.  
+ **Push notification:** Service-initiated message that is sent to a registered device or user using Azure Notification Hubs.
+ **Scale:** The ability to add, for an additional cost, more processing power, performance, and storage as your app becomes more popular.
+ **Scheduled job:** Custom code that is run either on a pre-determined schedule or on-demand.
+ **Server script:** Custom business logic code in a JavaScript backend mobile service. This code is registered to a table operation (read, insert, update, delete), custom API, or a scheduled job.
+ **Table:** User data is stored in tables in a SQL Database. You can create these tables in the Management Portal.
