Information about automobiles by make and model, including the price, features such as the number of cylinders and MPG, as well as an insurance risk score.<p> </p>The risk score is initially associated with auto price and then adjusted for actual risk in a process known to actuaries as symboling. A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, and a value of -3 that it is probably pretty safe.<p> </p><b>Usage:</b> Predict the risk score by features, using regression or multivariate classification. <p> </p><b>Related Research:</b> Schlimmer, J.C.
