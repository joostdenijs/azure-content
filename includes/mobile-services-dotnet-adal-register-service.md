5. Open the application manifest file with Visual Studio. At the top of the file find the app permissions line that looks as follows:

        "oauth2Permissions": [],

    Replace that line with the following app permissions and save the file.

        "oauth2Permissions": [
            {
                "adminConsentDescription": "Allow the application access to the mobile service",
                "adminConsentDisplayName": "Have full access to the mobile service",
                "id": "b69ee3c9-c40d-4f2a-ac80-961cd1534e40",
                "isEnabled": true,
                "origin": "Application",
                "type": "User",
                "userConsentDescription": "Allow the application full access to the mobile service on your behalf",
                "userConsentDisplayName": "Have full access to the mobile service",
                "value": "user_impersonation"
            }
        ],

6. In the Azure Management portal, click **Manage Manifest** for the application again and click **Upload Manifest**.  Browse to the location of the application manifest that you just updated and upload the manifest.
