1. In Visual Studio, press the F5 key to run the app.

2. Log in using the selected identity provider and verify that authentication succeeds.

   	Note that after the insert completes, the app receives a push notification from WNS.

4. (Optional) Repeat steps 1-3 on a different client device and using a different account when logging in.
