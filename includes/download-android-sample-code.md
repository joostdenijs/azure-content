This tutorial is built on **GetStartedWithData**, which is an Android app. The UI for this app is identical to the one in the Mobile Services Android quickstart, except that items that are added to the list are stored locally in memory. You will add the code needed to persist the data to storage.


1. Download the samples repository from gitHub by clicking <a href="https://github.com/Azure/mobile-services-samples" target="blank">here</a> and then Click **Download ZIP**.

2. Unzip the downloaded file and make a note of its location, or move it to your Android Studio projects directory.

3. Open Android Studio. If you are working with a different project and it appears, close the project (**File => Close Project**).

4. Select **Open an existing Android Studio project**, browse to the project location in the *AndroidStudio* folder of *GettingStartedWithData*, and then click **OK.**
