1. Browse to the location where you saved the compressed project files, expand the files on your computer, and open the project file using Xcode.

2. Press the **Run** button to build the project and start the app in the iPhone emulator.

3. In the app, type meaningful text, such as _Complete the tutorial_ and then click the plus (**+**) icon.
