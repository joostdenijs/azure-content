The dataset contains approximately 228K ratings for movies, extracted from well-structured tweets on Twitter. Each instance represents a tweet and is a tuple: user ID, IMDB movie ID, rating, and timestamp. The dataset was introduced in the paper "S. Dooms, T. De Pessemier and L. Martens. MovieTweetings: a Movie Rating Dataset Collected From Twitter. Workshop on Crowdsourcing and Human Computation for Recommender Systems, CrowdRec at RecSys 2013."
