This dataset contains a series of records from steel annealing trials with the physical attributes (width, thickness, type (coil, sheet, etc.) of the resulting steel types.<p> </p><b>Usage:</b> Predict any of two numeric class attributes; hardness or strength. You might also analyze correlations among attributes.<p> </p>Steel grades follow a set standard, defined by SAE and other organizations. You are looking for a specific 'grade' (the class variable) and want to understand the values needed. <p> </p><b>Related Research:</b> Sterling, D. & Buntine, W., (NA).
