#How to Detach a Data Disk from a Virtual Machine with the CLI

When you no longer need a data disk that is attached to a virtual machine, you can easily detach it. This removes the disk from the virtual machine, but doesn't remove it from storage. If you want to use the existing data on the disk again, you can reattach it to the same virtual machine, or another one.

> [AZURE.NOTE] A virtual machine in Azure uses different types of disks: an operating system disk, a local temporary disk, and optional data disks. Data disks are the recommended way to store data for a virtual machine. For details about disks, see [About disks and images](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=263439). It is not currently possible to detach an operating system disk.


1. Get the list of disks attached to your VM:

        vm disk list <vm-name>

    If you omit `<vm-name>`, you will get a list of all disks in your subscription.


2. Detach a disk:

        vm disk detach <vm-name> <lun>

    `lun` identifies the disk to be detached, and will be a number which can be found in your VM's disk list.
