Data in your storage account is replicated to ensure durability that is also highly available, meeting the [Azure Storage SLA ](http://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/) even in the face of transient hardware failures. Azure Storage is deployed in 15 regions around the world and also includes support for replicating data between regions. You have several options for replicating the data in your storage account:

- *Locally redundant storage (LRS)* maintains three copies of your data. LRS is replicated three times within a single facility in a single region. LRS protects your data from normal hardware failures, but not from the failure of a single facility.

	LRS is offered at a discount. For maximum durability, we recommend that you use geo-redundant storage, described below.

- *Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)* maintains three copies of your data. ZRS is replicated three times across two to three facilities, either within a single region or across two regions, providing higher durability than LRS. ZRS ensures that your data is durable within a single region.
 
	ZRS provides a higher level of durability than LRS; however, for maximum durability, we recommend that you use geo-redundant storage, described below.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] ZRS is currently available only for block blobs. Note that once you have created your storage account and selected zone-redundant replication, you cannot convert it to use to any other type of replication, or vice versa.

- *Geo-redundant storage (GRS)* is enabled for your storage account by default when you create it. GRS maintains six copies of your data. With GRS, your data is replicated three times within the primary region, and is also replicated three times in a secondary region hundreds of miles away from the primary region, providing the highest level of durability. In the event of a failure at the primary region, Azure Storage will failover to the secondary region. GRS ensures that your data is durable in two separate regions. 

	> [AZURE.NOTE] GRS is recommended over ZRS or LRS for maximum durability.

- *Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)* provides all of the benefits of geo-redundant storage noted above, and also allows read access to data at the secondary region at any time. Read-access geo-redundant storage is recommended for maximum availability in addition to durability.
