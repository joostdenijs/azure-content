This tutorial uses Android Studio and Android 4.2 or a later version. 

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Add Mobile Services to an existing app].

> [AZURE.NOTE] The Mobile Services Android SDK has been updated to version 2.0. If you completed the above two tutorials some time ago, you must redo them if they are not using the updated SDK. To verify what version of the SDK your app uses, open it in Android Studio and inspect the contents of the **libs** folder. The version numbers on the Mobile Services jar files should be 2.0 or higher.
