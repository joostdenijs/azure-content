When you use a Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager to load balance traffic to your Azure Website, that website can then be accessed using the **\*.trafficmanager.net** domain name assigned by Azure. You can also associate a custom domain name, such as www.contoso.com, with your website in order to provide a more recognizable domain name for your users.
