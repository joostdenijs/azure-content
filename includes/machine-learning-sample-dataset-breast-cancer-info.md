The dataset contains additional information for each suspicious region of X-ray image. Each example provides information (e.g., label, patient ID, coordinates of patch relative to the whole image) about the corresponding row number in the Breast Cancer Features dataset. Each patient has a number of examples. For patients who have a cancer, some examples are positive and some are negative. For patients who don't have a cancer, all examples are negative. The dataset has 102K examples. The dataset is biased, 0.6% of the points are positive, the rest are negative. The dataset was made available by Siemens Healthcare.
