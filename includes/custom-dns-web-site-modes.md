Setting a custom domain name is only available for the **Shared**, **Basic** and **Standard** modes for Web Apps. Before switching a web app from the **Free** mode to the **Shared**, **Basic** or **Standard** mode, you must first remove spending caps in place for your Web Apps subscription. 

For more information on the App Service plan modes, including how to change the mode of your site, see [How to scale web apps](web-sites-scale.md).
